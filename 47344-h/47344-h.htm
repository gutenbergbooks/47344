<h2 class="p4">PREFACE</h2>

<p class="p2">When the secret of the identity of Fiona Macleod&mdash;so
loyally guarded by a number of friends for twelve years&mdash;was
finally made known, much speculation arose as to
the nature of the dual element that had found expression
in the collective work of William Sharp. Many suggestions,
wide of the mark, were advanced; among others,
that the writer had assumed the pseudonym as a joke,
and having assumed it found himself constrained to continue
its use. A few of the critics understood. Prof.
Patrick Geddes realised that the discussion was productive
of further misunderstanding, and wrote to me:
“Should you not explain that F. M. was not simply W. S.,
but that W. S. in his deepest moods became F. M., a sort
of dual personality in short, not a mere nom-de-guerre?”
It was not expedient for me at that moment to do so. I
preferred to wait till I could prepare as adequate an explanation
as possible. My chief aim, therefore, in writing
about my husband and in giving a sketch of his life,
has been to indicate, to the best of my ability, the growth
and development in his work of the dual literary expression
of himself.</p>

<p>The most carefully compiled record of a life can be but
partially true, since much of necessity must be left unsaid.
A biographer, moreover, can delineate another
human being only to the extent of his understanding of
that fellow being. In so far as he lacks, not only knowledge
of facts, but also the illumination of intuition and
sympathy, to that extent will he fail to present a finished
study of his subject. And because no one can wholly
know another: because one of necessity interprets another
through the colour of his or her mind, I am very
conscious of my own limitations in this respect. As, however,
I have known William Sharp for more consecutive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span>
years than any other of his intimate friends, I perhaps
am able therefore to offer the fullest survey of the unfolding
of his life; though I realise that others may have
known him better than I on some sides of his nature: in
particular as he impressed those who had not discovered,
or were not in sympathy with, the “F. M.” phase in him.</p>

<p>The life of William Sharp divides itself naturally into
two halves: the first ends with the publication by W. S.
of <i>Vistas</i>, and the second begins with <i>Pharais</i>, the first
book signed Fiona Macleod. It has been my endeavour
to tell his story by means of letters and diaries; of letters
written by him, and of others written to him, concerning
his work and interests. To quote his own words: “A
group of intimate letters, written with no foreseen or
suspected secondary intention, will probably give us more
insight into the inner nature of a man than any number
of hypothetical pros and cons on the part of a
biographer, or than reams of autobiography.... I know
Keats for instance far better through his letters than
by even the ablest and most intimate memoirs that have
been written of him: the real man is revealed in them
and is brought near to us till we seem to hear his voice
and clasp his hand.”</p>

<p>The diaries are fragmentary. They were usually begun
at each New Year, but were speedily discontinued;
or noted down intermittently, during a sojourn abroad,
as a record of work. He was a good correspondent, both
as W. S. and F. M. I have thus tried to make the
book as autobiographic as possible, by means of these
letters and diaries, and I have added only what has
seemed to me necessary to make the narrative sequent.
Unfortunately, letters have not been available from several
valuable sources; and I regret the absence of any
written by him to Walter Pater, George Meredith, Theodore
Watts-Dunton, Arthur Symons, and to one or two of
his most intimate friends.</p>

<p>I take this opportunity of expressing to many friends
on both sides of the Atlantic my appreciation of their
courtesy in placing letters at my disposal; also for permission<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[vii]</a></span>
accorded to me by Mr. Robert Ross for the use of
letters from Oscar Wilde, and by Mr. Charles Baxter, for
letters from Robert Louis Stevenson. Through the kindness
of Mrs. Sturgis I have included among the illustrations
a portrait of her father George Meredith (dated
1898). I am indebted to Miss Pater for the photograph
of her brother Walter Pater; and to Mr. W. M. Rossetti
for that of his brother Dante Gabriel Rossetti.</p>

<p>Of the four portraits of William Sharp, herein reproduced,
the earliest was taken about the time of the publication
of his first volume of poems. The pastel by the
Norwegian painter, Charles Ross, was executed in Rome
in 1891, two years before <i>Pharais</i> was written; and the
etching by our friend, Mr. William Strang A.R.A., who
has kindly sanctioned my use of it, dates to 1896, in which
year were published <i>The Washer of the Ford</i>, <i>Green
Fire</i>, and <i>From the Hills of Dream</i>. The final portrait
of my husband was taken in Sicily in 1903 by the Hon.
Alexander Nelson Hood (Duke of Bronte), who also has
permitted me to reproduce his photograph of Il Castello
di Maniace, Bronte&mdash;on the inland shoulder of Etna&mdash;close
to which, on a sloping hillside, in the little woodland
burial ground, and within sound of rushing waters,
stands the Iona cross erected to the memory of William
Sharp and “Fiona Macleod<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[viii]</a></span>.”</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER I</h2>

<p class="pch">CHILDHOOD</p>

<p class="pbqn">“Childhood, when the child is as a flower of wilding growth,
and when it is at one with nature, fellow with the winds
and birds.”</p>

<p class="pbqr">W. S.</p>

<p class="p1">“That man is fortunate who has half his desires
gratified, who lives to see half his desires accomplished,”
says Schopenhauer, and taking the axiom to be true I
am not going back on it, for certainly more than half
of the desires of my boyhood and youth have been
fulfilled. I come of a West of Scotland stock which&mdash;perhaps
in part because of its Scandinavian admixture&mdash;has
always had in it ‘the wandering blood’: and from
my early days, when at the mature age of three I escaped
one night from the nursery and was found in the garden
at midnight, a huddled little white heap at the foot of
a great poplar that was at once my ceaseless delight and
wonder and a fascination that was almost terror, a desire
of roaming possessed me.”</p>

<p>That William Sharp should be one of the fortunates
who, toward the end of life, could say he had fulfilled
more than half of his early desires, was due mainly to
a ceaseless curiosity and love of adventure, to a happy
fearlessness of disposition that prompted him when
starting on any quest to seize the propitious moment,
and if necessary to burn his boats behind him. He believed
himself to have been born under a lucky star.
Notwithstanding the great hardships and difficulties
that sometimes barred his way, his vivid imagination,
aided by a strong will and untiring perseverance, opened
to him many doors of the wonderland of life that lured
him in his dreams. The adventurous and the romantic
were to him as beacons; and though their lights were
at times overshadowed by the tragedy of human life, his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
natural buoyancy of disposition, his power of whole-hearted
enjoyment in things large and small, his ready
intuitive sympathy, preserved in him a spirit of fine
optimism to the end.</p>

<p>The conditions of his early boyhood were favourable
to the development of his natural inclination.</p>

<p>He was born on the 12th of September, 1855, at 4
Garthland Place, Paisley, on a day when the bells were
ringing for the fall of Sebastopol. He was the eldest
of a family of three sons and five daughters. His
father, David Galbreath Sharp, a partner in an old-established
mercantile house, was the youngest son of William
Sharp, whose family originally came from near
Dunblane. His mother was a Miss Katherine Brooks,
the eldest daughter of William Brooks, Swedish Vice-Consul
at Glasgow, and of Swedish descent, whose wife
was a Miss Agnes Henderson, related to the Stewarts
of Shambellie and the Murrays of Philiphaugh.</p>

<p>Mr. David Sharp was a genial, observant man, humourous,
and a finished mimic. Though much of his life
was of necessity spent in a city, he had a keen love of the
country, and especially of the West Highlands. Every
summer he took a house for three or four months on the
shores of the Clyde, or on one of the beautiful sea lochs,
or on the island of Arran, now so exploited, but then
relatively secluded. Very early he initiated his son in
the arts of swimming, rowing, and line fishing; sailed
with him along the beautiful shores of the Western Highlands
and the Inner Hebrides.</p>

<p>Mrs. David Sharp had been brought up by her father
to read seriously, and to take an interest in his favourite
study of Geology. It was she who watched over
her son’s work at college, and made facilities for
him to follow his special pursuits at home. But the
boy was never urged to distinguish himself at college.
He was considered too delicate to be subjected to severe
mental pressure; and he met with no encouragement
from either parent in his wish to throw himself into the
study of science or literature as a profession, for such a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
course seemed to them to offer no prospects for his future.
It was from Mrs. Sharp that her son inherited his Scandinavian
physique and high colouring; for in appearance
he resembled his fair-complexioned, tall maternal grandfather.
The blend of nationalities in him, slight though
the Swedish strain was, produced a double strain. He
was, in the words of a friend, a Viking in build, a Scandinavian
in cast of mind, a Celt in heart and spirit.</p>

<p>As a little child he was very delicate.</p>

<p>The long months each year by mountain and sea, and
the devotion of his Highland nurse Barbara, and his delight
in open-air life, were the most potent factors in the
inward growth of his mind and spirit. From his earliest
days he was a passionate lover of nature, a tireless
observer of her moods and changes, for he had always
felt himself to be “at one with nature, fellow with
the winds and birds.” And Barbara, the Highland
woman, it was she who told him stories of Faerie,
crooned to him old Gaelic songs, and made his childish
mind familiar with the heroes of the old Celtic Sagas,
with the daring exploits of the Viking rovers and Highland
chieftains. It was she who sowed the seeds in his
mind of much that he afterward retold under the pseudonym
of Fiona Macleod.</p>

<p>There are two stories of his childhood I have heard
him tell, which seem to me to show that from earliest
years the distinctive characteristics of his markedly dual
nature existed and swayed him. From babyhood his
mind had been filled with stories of old heroic times,
and in his play he delighted in being the adventurous
warrior or marauding Viking. In the gray, inclement
days of winter when he was shut up in his nursery away
from the green life in the garden and the busy wee birds
in the trees, he was thrown on the resources of his imagination
to fill the long hours. One snowy day, when he
was five years old, and he was tired of playing with his
baby sisters, who could not sufficiently rise to the occasion
and play the distressed damsels to his deeds of knightly
chivalry, he determined to sally forth in search of adventure.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
He buckled his sword above his kilt&mdash;it was
afternoon and the light was waning&mdash;stole downstairs
and out of the house, hatless, with flying curls, and
marched down the street to lay siege to the nearest
castle. A short distance away stood the house of a
friend of his father, and upon that the besieger turned
his attack. It loomed in his mind as the castle of his
desire. He strode resolutely up to the door, with great
difficulty, on tiptoe, reached the handle of the bell,
pulled a long peal, and then demanded of the maid that
she and all within should surrender to him and deliver
up the keys of the castle. The maid fell in with his
humour, was properly frightened, and begged to be allowed
to summon her mistress, who at once promised
submission, led the victor into her room, and by a blazing
fire gave him the keys in the form of much coveted
sweets, held him in her lap till in the warmth he fell
asleep, rolled him up in a blanket, and carried him
home.</p>

<p>The other story is indicative not of the restless adventure-loving
side of him, but of the poet dreamer.</p>

<p>During the child’s sixth year his father had taken a
house for the summer months on the shores of Loch
Long; the great heather-clad hills, peak behind peak, the
deep waters of the winding loch, were a ceaseless delight
to the boy. But above all else there lay an undefined
attraction in a little wood, a little pine belt nestling on
the hillside above the house. It was an enchanted land to
him, away from the everyday world, where human beings
never came, but where he met his invisible playmates,
visible to him. “I went there very often,” he wrote
later. “I thought that belt of firs had a personality
as individual as that of any human being, a sanctity
not to be disturbed by sport or play.” It was a holy place
to him. The sense of the Infinite touched him there.
He had heard of God in the church, and as described
from the pulpit that Being was to him remote and forbidding.
But here he seemed conscious of a Presence that
was benign, beautiful. He felt there was some great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
power (he could not define the feeling to himself) behind
the beauty he saw; behind the wind he did not see,
but heard; behind the wonder of the sunshine and sunset
and in the silences he loved, that awoke in him
a desire to belong to it. And so, moved to express his
desire in some way, he built a little altar of stones,
rough stones, put together under a swaying pine, and on
it he laid white flowers in offering.</p>

<p>The three influences that taught him most in childhood
were the wind, the woods, and the sea. Water
throughout his life had an irresistible charm for him&mdash;the
sea, the mountain-loch, or the rushing headlong
waters of the hill-burns. To watch the play of moving
waters was an absorbing fascination, and he has told
me how one bright night he had crept on to a ledge of
wet rocks behind a hill water-fall and had lain there so
that he might watch the play of moonlight through the
shimmering veil of waters.</p>

<p>“When I was a child,” he wrote later, “I used to
throw offerings&mdash;small coins, flowers, shells, even a
newly caught trout, once a treasured flint arrow-head&mdash;into
the sea-loch by which we lived. My Hebridean
nurse had often told me of Shony, a mysterious sea-god,
and I know I spent much time in wasted adoration: a
fearful worship, not unmixed with disappointment and
some anger. Not once did I see him. I was frightened
time after time, but the sudden cry of a heron, or the
snort of a pollack chasing the mackerel, or the abrupt
uplifting of a seal’s head became over-familiar, and I
desired terror, and could not find it by the shore. Inland,
after dusk, there was always the mysterious multitude
of shadow. There, too, I could hear the wind leaping
and growling. But by the shore I never knew any
dread, even in the darkest night. The sound and company
of the sea washed away all fears.”</p>

<p>But the child was not a dreamer only. He was a high-spirited
little chap, who loved swimming and fishing
and climbing; and learned at an early age to handle the
oar and the tiller, and to understand the ways and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
moods of a sailing boat; afraid of nothing and ready
for any adventure that offered.</p>

<p>My first recollections of him go back to my childhood.
We were cousins; my father was his father’s older
brother. My mother was the daughter of Robert Farquharson,
of Breda and Allargue. In 1863 my Uncle
David had a house at Blairmore on the Gare-loch for
the summer, and my mother took her children to the
neighbouring village of Strone, so that the cousins
might become acquainted. My impression of “Willie”
is vivid: a merry, mischievous little boy in his eighth
year, with bright-brown curly hair, blue-gray eyes, and a
laughing face, and dressed in a tweed kilt; eager, active
in his endless invention of games and occupations, and
a veritable despot over his sisters in their play. He interested
his London cousins in showing them how to find
crabs and spouting fish, birds’ nests, and brambles; terrified
them with tales of snakes in the grass on the hills,
and of the ghostly things that flitted about the woods at
night. But his chief delight was his punt. A great part
of the day he spent on and in the water, shouting with
delight as he tossed on the waves in the wake of a
steamer, and he occasionally startled us by being apparently
capsized into the water, disappearing from sight,
and then clambering into the punt dripping and happy.
But I remember that with all his love of fun and teasing,
he seemed to feel himself different from the other children
of his age, and would fly off alone to the hillside or
to the woods to his many friends among the birds and
the squirrels and the rabbits, with whose ways and habitations
he seemed so familiar.</p>

<p>About the dream and vision side of his life he learned
early to be silent. He soon realised that his playmates
understood nothing of the confused memories of
previous lives that haunted him, and from which he
drew materials to weave into stories for his school-fellows
in the dormitory at nights. To his surprise he
found they saw none of the denizens of the other worlds&mdash;tree
spirits and nature spirits, great and small&mdash;so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
familiar to him, and who he imagined must be as obvious
to others as to himself. He could say about them as
Lafcadio Hearn said about ghosts and goblins, that he
believed in them for the best of possible reasons, because
he saw them day and night.</p>

<p>He found, as have other imaginative psychic children,
that he had an inner life, a curious power of vision unshared
by any one about him; so that what he related
was usually discredited. But the psychic side of his
nature was too intimately a part of himself to be killed
by misunderstanding. He learned early to shut it away&mdash;keep
it as a thing apart&mdash;a mystery of his own, a
mystery to himself. This secrecy had two direct results:
he needed from time to time to get away alone,
from other people, so as again and again to get into
touch with “the Green Life,” as he called it, for spiritual
refreshment; and it developed in him a love not
only of mystery for its own sake, but of mystification
also that became a marked characteristic, and eventually
was one of the factors which in his literary work
led to the adoption of the pseudonym.</p>

<p>Once only, as far as I know, in the short psychic tale
called “The Four Winds of the Spirit,” did he, in his
writings, make any reference to his invisible playmates.
I have often heard him speak of a beautiful, gentle
white Lady of the Woods, about whom he once wrote
in a letter: “For I, too, have my dream, my memory
of one whom as a child I called Star-Eyes, and whom
later I called ‘Baumorair-na-mara,’ the Lady of the
Sea, and whom at least I knew to be no other than the
woman who is in the heart of women. I was not more
than seven when one day, by a well, near a sea-loch in
Argyll, just as I was stooping to drink, my glancing eyes
lit on a tall woman standing among a mist of wild hyacinths
under three great sycamores. I stood, looking,
as a fawn looks, wide-eyed, unafraid. She did not speak,
but she smiled, and because of the love and beauty in
her eyes I ran to her. She stooped and lifted blueness
out of the flowers, as one might lift foam out of a pool,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
and I thought she threw it over me. When I was found
lying among the hyacinths dazed, and, as was thought,
ill, I asked eagerly after the lady in white, and with
hair all shiny-gold like buttercups, but when I found I
was laughed at, or at last, when I passionately persisted,
was told I was sun-dazed and had been dreaming, I said
no more&mdash;but I did not forget.”</p>

<p>This boy dreamer began his education at home under
a governess, and of those early days I know little except
that he was tractable, easily taught, and sunny-natured.</p>

<p>He has given an account of his first experiences at
school in a paper, “In the Days of my Youth,” which
he was asked to contribute to <i>M. A. P.</i></p>

<p>“The first tragedy in my life was when I was captured
for the sacrifice of school. At least to me it
seemed no less than a somewhat brutal and certainly
tyrannical capture, and my heart sank when, at the age
of eight (I did not know how fortunate I was to have
escaped the needless bondage of early schooling till I
was eight years old), I was dispatched to what was then
one of the chief boarding-schools in Scotland, Blair
Lodge, in Polmont Woods, between Falkirk and Linlithgow.
It was beautifully situated, and though I then
thought the woods were forests and the Forth and Clyde
canal a mighty stream, I was glad some years ago, on
revisiting the spot, to find that my boyish memories
were by no means so exaggerated as I feared. I am
afraid I was much more of a credit to my shepherd and
fisher and gipsy friends than to my parents or schoolmasters.</p>

<p>“On the very day of my arrival a rebellion had broken
out, and by natural instinct I was, like the Irishman
the moment he arrived in America, ‘agin the Government.’
I remember the rapture with which I evaded a
master’s pursuing grip, and was hauled in at a window
by exultant rebels. In that temporary haven the same
afternoon I insulted a big boy, whose peculiar physiognomy
had amazed me to delighted but impolite laughter,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
and forthwith experienced my first school thrashing.
Later in the day I had the satisfaction of coming
out victor in an equal combat with the heir of an
Indian big-wig, whom, with too ready familiarity, I
had addressed as ‘Curry.’ As I was a rather delicate
and sensitive child, this was not a bad beginning, and
I recollect my exhilaration (despite aching bones and
smarting spots) in the thought that ‘school’ promised
to be a more lively experience than I had anticipated.</p>

<p>“I ran away three times, and I doubt if I learned
more indoors than I did on these occasions and in my
many allowed and stolen outings. The first flight for
freedom was an ignominious failure. The second occasion
two of us were Screaming Eagle and Sitting Bull,
and we had a smothered fire o’ nights and ample provender
(legally and illegally procured), and we might
have become habitual woodlanders had I not ventured to
a village and rolled downhill before me a large circular
cheese, for which, alas! I now blush to say, I forgot to
pay or even to leave my name and address. That cheese
was our undoing. The third time was nearly successful,
and but for a gale my life, in all probability, would
have had an altogether different colour and accent. We
reached the port of Grangemouth, and were successful
in our plot to hide ourselves as stowaways. We slept
that night amid smells, rats, cockroaches, and a mysterious
congregation of ballast and cargo, hoping to
wake to the sound of waves. Alas! a storm swept the
Forth from west to the east. The gale lasted close on
three days. On the morning of the third, three pale
and wretched starvelings were ignominiously packed
back to Blair Lodge, where the admiration of comrades
did not make up for punishment fare and a liberal flogging.</p>

<p>“A fourth attempt, however, proved successful,
though differently for each of us. One of the three, a
rotund, squirrel-eyed boy, named Robinson, was shipped
off as an apprentice in an Indiaman. A few years later<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
he went to his dreamed-of South Seas, was killed in a
squabble with hostile islanders, and, as was afterward
discovered, afforded a feast (I am sure a succulent one)
to his captors. The second of the three is now a dean
in the Anglican Church. I have never met him, but once
at a big gathering I saw the would-be pirate in clerical
garb, with a protuberant front, and bald. I think Robinson
had the better luck. As for the third of the three,
he has certainly had his fill of wandering, if he has
never encountered cannibals and if he is neither a dean
nor bald.”</p>

<p>When their son was twelve years old, William’s parents
left Paisley and took a house in Glasgow (India Street),
and he was sent as a day scholar to the Glasgow Academy.
In his sixteenth year he was laid low with a severe
attack of typhoid fever. It was to that summer during
the long months of convalescence in the West that many
of his memories of Seumas Macleod belong. Of this
old fisherman he wrote: “When I was sixteen I was on
a remote island where he lived, and on the morrow of
my visit I came at sunrise upon the old man standing
looking seaward with his bonnet removed from his long
white locks; and upon my speaking to Seumas (when I
saw he was not ‘at his prayers’) was answered, in
Gaelic of course, ‘Every morning like this I take my
hat off to the beauty of the world.’ Although I was sent
to the Academy at Glasgow, and afterward to the University,
I spent much of each year in boating, sailing,
hill-climbing, wandering, owing to the unusual freedom
allowed to me during our summer residence in the country
and during the other vacations. From fifteen to
eighteen I sailed up every loch, fjord, and inlet in the
Western Highlands and islands, from Arran and Colonsay
to Skye and the Northern Hebrides, from the Rhinns
of Galloway to the Ord of Sutherland. Wherever I went
I eagerly associated myself with fishermen, sailors,
shepherds, gamekeepers, poachers, gipsies, wandering
pipers, and other musicians.” In this way he made
many friends, especially among the fishermen and shepherds,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
stayed with them in their houses, and, ‘having
the Gaelic,’ talked with them, gained their confidence,
and listened to tales told by old men, and old mothers
by the fireside during the long twilight evenings, or in
the herring-boats at night.</p>

<p>“At eighteen I ‘took to the heather,’ as we say in the
north, for a prolonged period....” Up the Gare-loch,
close to Ardentinny, there was a point of waste land
running into the water, frequently used as camping
ground by roving tinkers and gipsies. Many a time he
sailed there in his little boat to get in touch with these
wandering folk. One summer he found there an encampment
of true gipsies, who had come over from mid-Europe,
a fine, swarthy, picturesque race. The appeal
was irresistible, strengthened by the attraction of a
beautiful gipsy girl. He made friends with the tribe,
and persuaded the ‘king’ to let him join them; and so
he became ‘star-brother’ and ‘sun-brother’ to them,
and wandered with them over many hills and straths of
the West Highlands. To him, who at all times hated the
restrictions and limitations of conventional life, to
whom romance was a necessity, this free life ‘on the
heather’ was the realisation of many dreams. In those
few months he learned diverse things; much wood-lore,
bird-lore, how to know the ways of the wind, and to use
the stars as compass. I do not know exactly how long he
was with the camp; two months, perhaps, or three. For
to him they were so full of wonder, so vivid, that in later
life, when he spoke of them, he lost all count of time, and
on looking back to those days, packed with new and keen
experiences so wholly in keeping with his temperament,
weeks seemed as months, and he ceased to realise that the
experience was compressed into one short summer. He
never wove these memories into a sequent romance,
though in later time he thought of so doing. For one
thing, the present was the absorbing actuality to him,
and the future a dream to realise; whether in life or in
work the past was past, and he preferred to project himself
toward the future and what it might have in store<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
for him. But traces of the influence of those gipsy days
are to be seen in <i>Children of To-morrow</i>, in the character
of Annaik in <i>Green Fire</i>, and in the greater part of
the story of “The Gipsy Christ,” published later in the
collection of short stories entitled <i>Madge o’ the Pool</i>. He
also had projected a romance to be called <i>The Gipsy
Trail</i>, but it was never even begun.</p>

<p>One thing, however, I know for certain, that the truant’s
parents were greatly concerned over his disappearance.
After considerable trouble the fugitive was
recaptured. Not long after he was put into a lawyer’s
office, ostensibly to teach him business habits, but also
the better to chain him to work, to the accepted conventions
of life, and to remove him out of the way of dangerous
temptations offered by the freer College life with
its long vacations.</p>

<p>“Not long after my return to civilisation, at my
parent’s urgent request, I not only resumed my classes
at the University, but entered a lawyer’s office in Glasgow
(on very easy conditions, hardly suitable for a professional
career), so as to learn something of the law.
I learned much more, in a less agreeable fashion, when
I spent my first years in London and understood the
pains and penalties of impecuniosity! The only outside
influence which had strongly perturbed my boyhood was
the outbreak of the Franco-German War, and I recall
the eager excitement with which I followed the daily
news, my exultation when the French were defeated,
my delight when the Prussians won a great victory.
A few years later I would have ‘sided’ differently,
but boys naturally regarded the French as hereditary
foes.”</p>

<p>In the autumn of 1871 he had been enrolled as student
at the Glasgow University, and he attended the sessions
of 1871-72 and 1872-73 during the Lord Rectorship of
The Right Honourable B. Disraeli. He did not remain
long enough at the university to take his degree. Yet he
worked well, and was an attentive scholar. Naturally,
English Literature was the subject that attracted him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
specially; in that class he was under Prof. John Nichol,
whose valued friendship he retained for many years.
At the end of his second session he was one of three
students who were found ‘worthy of special commendation.’
The chief benefit to him of his undergraduate
days was the access it gave him to the University Library.
There new worlds of fascinating study were
opened to him; not only the literature and philosophy of
other European countries, but also the wonderful literatures
and religions of the East. He read omnivorously;
night after night he read far into the morning
hours literature, philosophy, poetry, mysticism, occultism,
magic, mythology, folk-lore. While on the one hand
the immediate result was to turn him from the form of
Presbyterian faith in which he had been brought up, to
put him in conflict with all orthodox religious teachings,
it strengthened the natural tendency of his mind toward
a belief in the unity of the great truths underlying all
religions; and, to his deep satisfaction, gave him a sense
of brotherhood with the acknowledged psychics and
seers of other lands and other days. At last he found
a sympathetic correspondence with his thoughts and experiences,
and a clew to their possible meaning and
value.</p>

<p>In 1874, with a view to finding out in what direction his
son’s capabilities lay, Mr. David Sharp put him into the
office of Messrs. Maclure and Hanney, lawyers, in Glasgow,
where he remained till his health broke down and he
was sent to Australia. It was soon evident that he would
never be a shining light in the legal profession: his chief
interest still lay in his private studies and his earliest
efforts in literature. In order to find time for all he
wished to do, which included a keen interest in the theatre
and opera whenever the chance offered, he allowed
himself during these two years four hours only
out of the twenty-four for sleep; a procedure which
did not tend to strengthen his already delicate health.
At no time in his life did he weigh or consider what
amount of physical strength he had at his disposal. His<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
will was strong, his desires were definite; he expected his
strength to be adequate to his requirements, and assumed
it was so, until, from time to time, a serious
breakdown proved to him how seriously he had overdrawn
on his reserve.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER II</h2>

<p class="pch">AUSTRALIA</p>

<p>My second meeting with my cousin was in August of
1875, when he spent a week with us at a cottage my
mother had taken at Dunoon, then one of the most
charming villages on the Clyde.</p>

<p>I remember vividly the impression he made on me
when I saw the tall, thin figure pass through our garden
gateway at sunset&mdash;he had come down by the evening
steamer from Glasgow&mdash;and stride swiftly up the path.
He was six feet one inch in height, very thin, with
slightly sloping shoulders. He was good-looking, with
a fair complexion and high colouring; gray-blue eyes,
brown hair closely cut, a sensitive mouth, and winning
smile. He looked delicate, but full of vitality. He spoke
very rapidly, and when excited his words seemed to tumble
one over the other, so that it was not always easy to
understand him.</p>

<p>In September my sister and I visited our Uncle and
Aunt at 16 Rosslyn Terrace, Glasgow, and before the
close of that month their son and I were secretly plighted
to one another. Then began a friendship that lasted unbrokenly
for thirty years.</p>

<p>It was then he confided to me that his true ambition
lay not in being a scientific man, as it was supposed, but
a poet: that his desire was to write about Mother Nature
and her inner mysteries, but that as yet he had
not sufficient mastery of his art to be able to put his message
into adequate form. After much persuasion he
read to me several of his early attempts, and promised
to send me a copy of whatever he should write.</p>

<p>We were very anxious to meet again before I returned
to London, as we should of necessity be separated till
the following autumn. A few days later in Edinburgh<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
came the desired opportunity. But how and where to
meet? No one must know, lest our secret should be discovered&mdash;for
we well knew all our relations would be
unanimous in disapproval.</p>

<p>Instead of going to the Lawyer’s office one morning
my cousin took an early train into Edinburgh&mdash;and I left
my sister to make the necessary excuses for my absence
at luncheon. But where to meet? We knew we should
run the risk of encountering relations and acquaintances
in the obvious places that suggested themselves.
At last a brilliant idea came to my betrothed, and we
spent several hours in&mdash;the secluded Dean Cemetery,
and were not found out! We talked and talked&mdash;about
his ambitions, his beliefs and visions, our hopeless prospects,
the coming lonely months, my studies&mdash;and parted
in deep dejection.</p>

<p>The immediate outcome of the day was a long poem
of no less than fifty-seven verses addressed to me:
“In Dean Cemetery”&mdash;a pantheistic dream, as its author
described it; and in a note to one of the verses he
wrote: “I hold to the rest of the poem, for there <i>are</i>
spirits everywhere. We are never alone, though we are
rarely conscious of other presences.”</p>

<p>The poem is too long and too immature to quote from.
It was one of a series, never of course published, that
he wrote about this time; all very serious, for his mind
was absorbed in psychic and metaphysical speculation.</p>

<p>And the reason why he chose such serious types of
poems to dedicate to the girl to whom he was engaged
was that she was the first friend he had found who to
some extent understood him, understood the inner hidden
side of his nature, sympathised with and believed in
his visions, dreams, and aims.</p>

<p>Immediately on my return to London he sent me
three long poems written in 1873 under the influence of
Shelley&mdash;then to him the poet of poets. Very faulty in
their handling, they are to me significant, inasmuch as
they strike the keynote of all his subsequent intimate
writings. “To the Pine Belt” begins with these lines:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span></p>

<p class="ppn6 p1">To-day amid the pines I went<br />
In a wonderment,<br />
For the ceaseless song<br />
Of lichened branches long<br />
In measures free<br />
Said to me<br />
Strange things of another life<br />
Than woodland strife.</p>

<p class="pn1">In <i>The Blue Peaks</i> he sings of the Quest of the beckoning
dim blue hills, of which he wrote again many years
later in <i>The Divine Adventure</i>. And the third, “The
River το καλυγ,” is an ecstatic chant to Beauty:</p>

<p class="ppn6 p1">O Spirit fair<br />
Who dwelleth where<br />
The heart of Beauty is enshrined.</p>

<p class="p1">Wherewith he invokes “Nature, or Beauty, or God” to
help him to realise the poignant dream of beauty, which
haunted him in diverse ways throughout his life. When
he sent them to me he realised how youthful and faulty
was the presentment, and he wrote: “If I had not promised
to send these poems I should certainly not do so
now. They are very poor every way, and the only interest
they may have for you is to show you the former
current of my thoughts&mdash;I did indeed put Beauty in the
place of God, and Nature in that of his Laws. Now that
I see more clearly (and that is not saying much), these
appear trash. Still there is some good here and there.
I am glad I have written them, for they helped me to
arrive at clearer convictions. The verse and rhythm
are purposely uneven and irregular&mdash;it admitted of
easier composition to write so.” While at the University
he had made an eager study of comparative religions,
their ethics and metaphysics, being then in active
revolt against the religious teachings in which he
had been brought up. This mental conflict, this weighing
of metaphysical problems, found expression in the
first Book of a projected Epic on Man, to be called <i>Upland,
Woodland, Cloudland</i>. “Amid the Uplands” only
was finished, and consists of two thousand lines in blank<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
verse; the leading idea is fairly suggested in these lines
from the Proem:</p>

<p class="ppq6 p1">“And I have written in the love of God<br />
And in a sense of man’s proud destiny.</p>

<p class="pn1">Scattered through the many pages of philosophic exhortation
and speculation, of descriptions of nature,
of psychical visions, are lines that are suggestive of later
development, of later trend of thought, and from them
the following are selected:</p>

<p class="ppq6 p1">“There is in everything an undertone ...<br />
Those clear in soul are also clear in sight,<br />
And recognise in a white cascade’s flash,<br />
The roar of mountain torrents, and the wail<br />

Beating the soft air of a dewy dusk,<br />

<p class="p1">In the beginning of 1875 he made various experiments
in rhymed metre, all equally serious in subject and stiff
in handling; but in the latter part of the year he wrote
several little songs in a lighter vein and happier manner.</p>

<p>The following year brought a fresh change in his circumstances,
and placed him face to face with the serious
questions of practical means of living. His father had
been in bad health for some months, and he himself developed
disquieting symptoms of chest trouble. I had
been in Italy during the three spring months, and was
overjoyed on my return to hear that we and my uncle’s
family were to spend August at Dunoon in neighbouring
houses. On arriving there we found my uncle in an
alarming condition and his son looking extremely delicate.
Nevertheless there were many happy days spent
there&mdash;and rambling over the hills, boating and sailing
on the lochs, in talking over our very vague prospects,
in reading and discussing his poems. Of these he had
several more to show me, chief among them being an
idyll “Beatrice,” dedicated to me, and a lyrical drama
“Ariadne in Naxos” which excited in me the greatest
admiration and pride. Toward the middle of the month
my uncle’s condition grew hopeless, and on the 20th he
died. His death was a great shock to his son, whose
health gave way: consumption was feared (as it proved,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
causelessly) and in the autumn he was ordered a voyage
to Australia.</p>

<p>In September I was taken by my mother to Aberdeenshire,
and thus I had no opportunity of seeing William
again, and the last thing I heard of him, when he had
left Scotland in a sailing ship, was a gloomy prediction
made by an old relative to my mother: “Ah, that poor
nephew of yours, Willie Sharp, he’ll never live to reach
Australia.”</p>

<p>To quote his own words:</p>

<p>“So to Australia I went by sailing ship, relinquishing
my idea of becoming a formidable rival to Swinburne
(whose <i>Atalanta in Calydon</i> had inspired me to a lyrical
drama named <i>Ariadne in Naxos</i>), to Tennyson
(whose example I had deigned to accept for an idyll
called ‘Beatrice’), and to the author of <i>Festus</i>, whose
example was responsible for a meditative epic named
‘Amid the Uplands.’ Alas! ‘subsequent events’ make
it unlikely that these masterpieces will ever see the
light.</p>

<p>“In Australia I had friends with whom I stayed, and
from them I joined an eminent colonist whose tragic
end cast a cloud over a notable career as an explorer.
With him I saw much of the then wild country in Gippsland,
beyond the Buffalo and Bogong Mountains, across
the Murray River into the desert region of lower New
South Wales.”</p>

<p>So to Australia he sailed, not only in search of health
but to look about and see if he would care to settle there,
supposing that he should find work that he could do, as
it was now imperative he should provide for his future.
In <i>The Sport of Chance</i>, and in an article “Through
Bush and Fern,” he has given graphic descriptions of the
memorable ride which afforded the newcomer a unique
opportunity of seeing something of the interior of the
colony; and from these the following selections are
taken:</p>

<p>“It was the full tide of summer when my friend and I
started one morning in continuance of our ride south<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
through the ranges that rise and swell and slope away
in mighty hollows, sweeping like immense green waves
around the bases of those lofty Australian Alps, of which
Mounts Hotham, Kosciusko, and Feathertop are the
chief glories. Although early, the heat of the sun was already
very powerful; but its effect was more bracing
than enervating, owing to the clearness and dryness of
the atmosphere.... Across the rugged mountains we
rode, by difficult passes over desolate plains, along
sweeping watercourses marked by the long funeral procession
of lofty blue-gums, and mournful, stringy bark.
Day by day we saw the sun rise above the hills. We
slept, while our horses stood by panting with heat, under
what shade we could get, and arose when the sky had
lost its look of molten copper and had taken on once
more its intense ultramarine. At night as we rode
across the plains we heard the howling of the wild dogs
as they scoured afar off, or sent flying in all directions
startled kangaroos, which leaped across the moonlit
wastes like ghosts of strange creatures in pre-Adamite
times.... At last we had come to Albury to join a
friend who promised us some swan shooting, and it
thus came about that early one morning, about an hour
before dawn, we found ourselves crouching under the
shelter of some wattles growing close to the Murray
lagoons. Not a sound was to be heard save the monotonous
swish of the river as it swept slowly onward, except
when at rare intervals some restless parrot or
cockatoo made a transient disturbance somewhere in the
forest. The stillness, the semi-darkness, the sound of
the rushing water, our expectancy, all rendered the hour
one of mingled solemnity and excited tension; and it
was with difficulty that at least one of our small party
repressed some sound when within a few feet a venomous-looking
snake wriggled away with a faint hiss from
a bunch of knotted grass.”</p>

<p>At this juncture, unfortunately the writer was carried
away by his interest in snakes ... in rare water
birds and “Murray-cod,” and quite forgot to finish his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
account of the swan shooting. It is obviously unnecessary
to explain that shooting, as a sport, had no attraction
for him; whereas observing birds and bats, fish,
etc., was always a preoccupying interest.</p>

<p>“What a day of intense heat followed that morning!
When at last we reached our previous night’s shelter, a
shepherd station known as Bidgee Bend, we were nearly
exhausted.</p>

<p>“While resting on a rough shake-down and lazily smoking,
my eye happened to glance at my saddle, which was
lying close at hand, and right in the midst thereof I saw
a large scorpion with its tail raised in that way which
is known to signify a vicious state of mind. Hearing my
exclamation, the stockman looked round, and without
a word reached for a long-lashed whip, and with a blow
of the shaft put an end to the possibly dangerous intentions
of our unwelcome visitor. Of an extremely laconic
nature, our shepherd friend never uttered a word he felt
to be unnecessary, and when, after having asked him if
he saw scorpions frequently hereabouts, and received a
monosyllabic reply in the affirmative, I added, ‘Any
other kind of vermin?’ he muttered sleepily, with his
pipe in his mouth, ‘Bull-dog ants, hairy spiders, centipedes,
bugs.’”</p>

<p>On his return to Melbourne the traveller realised that
there was no immediate prospect of finding work. He
had made inquiries in every available direction, but he
did not make any great effort. He realised that life in
the New World, under such conditions as would be open
to him, would be very distasteful; and greatly as he
had enjoyed the few months’ sojourn in Australia, owing
chiefly to Mr. Turner’s friendliness, he had little regret
when he went on board the <i>Loch Tay</i> for his homeward
faring.</p>

<p>The return voyage, too, was eventful. The route lay
round Cape Horn, and the ship was driven by contrary
winds down into the Antarctic seas, where it encountered
bitterly cold weather, and came close to drifting
icebergs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span></p>

<p>The <i>Loch Tay</i> reached England in June, and the wanderer
came direct to my mother’s house in London and
stayed with us there for several weeks. This first
visit to London was uneventful, but full of quiet happiness
for us both. He had, of course, much to see,
and it was a delight to me to be his cicerone. It was,
moreover, a much wished-for opportunity to introduce
him to my special friends, while my mother made him
known to whosoever she thought would be influential in
helping her nephew to find some suitable post or occupation.</p>

<p>I had three friends in particular I wanted him to
know; two were then in London; but the third, John
Elder, was in New Zealand, and did not return till the following
year. His sister, however, Miss Adelaide Elder,
was in town. She and my sister had been my confidants
during the preceding two years in the matter of our
engagement, and I was naturally most wishful that she
and my cousin should meet. We had known each other
from childhood&mdash;our parents were old friends&mdash;and we
had read and studied together, often in a quiet part of
Kensington Gardens reading Tennyson, Carlyle, John
Stuart Mill, Fichte, etc. The other friend was Miss
Alison&mdash;afterward Mrs. Mona Caird&mdash;the novelist and
essay writer. We three were friends with many tastes
and interests in common, not the least being all questions
relating to women. To my great satisfaction out of the
meeting with my cousin there grew deeply attached
friendships that lasted throughout his life.</p>

<p>In spite of all our efforts no work was found for the
wanderer; he spent the remainder of the year in Scotland
and devoted his time to writing. I have about two
letters written to me about that time. In one, dated August
21st from Braemar, he says:</p>

<p>“I feel another self within me now more than ever;
it is as if I were possessed by a spirit who must speak
out.... I am in no hurry to rush into print; I do not
wish to write publicly until I can do so properly. It
would be a great mistake to embody my message in such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
a poem as ‘Uplands,’ although a fifty times better poem
than that is. People won’t be preached to. Truth can
be inculcated far better by inference, by suggestion....
I am glad to see by your note you are in good spirits.
I also now look on things in a different light; but, unfortunately,
Lill, we poor mortals are more apt to be
swayed by moods than by circumstances, and look on
things through the mist of these moods.”</p>

<p>In the other letter he wrote:</p>

<p>“I am too worried about various things to settle to
any kind of literary work in the meantime. The weather
has been wretchedly wet, and the cold is intense. I
do trust I shall get away from Scotland before the winter
sets in, as I am much less able to stand it than I
thought I was. Even with the strong air up here I can’t
walk any distance without being much the worse for it.”</p>

<p>One cause of the “worry” was a candid letter of criticism
he had received from Robert Buchanan, whose
<i>The Book of Orm</i> had been one of his great favourites
among books of modern verse. Its fine mysticism appealed
to him, and to the author he sent a number of
his poems, and asked for a criticism and hoping for a
favourable one. But, alas, when it came it was uncompromisingly
the reverse; and the older poet strongly
advised the young aspirant not to dream of literature
as a career. Many years ago, he explained, when he
was struggling in London he tried in vain to get certain
employment of the kind, but he had never succeeded and
had had “to buffet the sharp sea of journalism.” It was
a great blow. It produced a deep and prolonged depression,
and it required all my powers of persuasion and
reiterated belief in his possibilities to enable him to pull
himself together and try again.</p>

<p>His hope was unfulfilled and he remained in Scotland
throughout the winter, at Moffat, where his mother had
taken a house. Despite the cold and the delay, he enjoyed
the long rambles over the snow-clad hills and in
the fir woods; and wrote a number of poems afterward
published in <i>The Human Inheritance</i>; and so vivid were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
certain effects of sunglow in the winter woods, that he
described them in one of his last writings included in
<i>Where the Forest Murmurs</i>.</p>

<p>But for the most part his mood was one of depression;
under it he wrote the following sonnet:</p>

<p class="pc1">THE GATE OF DEATH</p>

<p class="pph6 p1">I wonder if the soul upon that day<br />
When Death’s gate opens to it, will with gaze<br />
Rapt and bewilder’d tremble at the rays</p>
<p class="pph6">Of God’s great glory&mdash;or if wild dismay</p>
<p class="pph6">Will stun it with blank horror, while away<br />
It watches the unguided world blaze<br />
With speed relentless down the flowing ways</p>
<p class="pph6">That end in nothing; while far off a gray</p>
<p class="pph6">Wan shadow trembles ere it fades for aye?<br />
Or if, half blinded still with death’s amaze,</p>
<p class="pph6">Dimly and faintly it will somewhat see,<br />
Some Shadow become substance and unroll</p>
<p class="pph6">Until there looms one vast Humanity,<br />
One awful, mighty, and resistless Whole?</p>

<p class="p1">In the late Spring of 1878 William Sharp settled in
London. An opening had been found for him in the
City of Melbourne Bank by Mr. Alexander Elder, the
father of our friends, just in time to prevent him from
carrying out his decision to go as a volunteer in the
Turkish army during its conflict with Russia.</p>

<p>Neither the work nor the prospects offered were inviting,
but he was thankful to have a chance of trying his
fortunes in London. He bound himself as clerk in the
Bank for three years, on a salary of £80, £90, and £100.
As owing to the long idleness he had unavoidable debts
to pay off, he determined to try what he could do with
his pen to add to the slender income. He took a room
in 19 Albert Street, Regent’s Park, whence he could
walk to the Bank, yet sleep not far away from birds
and trees; and he had the good fortune to fall in with
a kindly, competent landlady. Now began a long, arduous
struggle for the means of livelihood, for health,
for a place among the literary writers of his day&mdash;a
“schooling in the pains and impecuniosities of life<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>”
from which he learned so much. He had no influence
to help him; and no friends other than those he had
met at my mother’s house. Each week-end he came
to 72 Inverness Terrace and stayed with us from Saturday
till Monday. A serious difficulty now presented
itself, one which threatened us both with temporary disaster.
As long as my betrothed was in Scotland it was
quite possible to preserve the secret of our engagement.
Now that he was in London and a constant visitor at our
house it was not so simple a matter. Moreover, to me
it did not seem honourable toward my mother, and I
wished her to know. He, however, was not of my opinion;
not only would he lose much&mdash;we both believed we
could not win my mother to our way of thinking&mdash;if
he were forbidden to come to the house, but he also
delighted in the very fact of the secrecy, of the mystery,
and, indeed, mystification, which I did not then realise
was a marked characteristic of his nature. For me such
secrecy had no charm, but was fraught with difficulties
and inconveniences. Many were our discussions, and at
last he yielded an unwilling consent.</p>

<p>One Sunday afternoon in the late summer a dejected
couple wandered about in Kensington Gardens, under
the old trees, trying to forecast what seemed a mournful
future. However, our fears were groundless. My
mother, though she felt it her duty to point out to us the
hopelessness and foolishness of the engagement from a
worldly point of view, her strong objection to it on the
score of our cousinship, his delicacy and lack of prospects,
nevertheless realised the uselessness of opposing
her daughter’s decision, accepted the inevitable, and from
that moment treated her nephew as her son.</p>

<p>Two months later he wrote to me:</p>


<p class="pr4 p1">26: 8: 78.<br /></p>

<p class="pbq">... Thanks for your welcome note which I received
a little ago. I, too, like you, was sitting at my open window
last night (or rather this morning) with the stars
for my companions: and I, too, took comfort from them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
and felt the peace hidden in their silent depths. I know
of nothing that soothes the spirit more than looking on
those awful skies at midnight. Some of our aspirations
seem to have burnt into life there, and, tangled in some
glory of starlight, to shine down upon us with beckoning
hands.... I have told you before how that music, a
beautiful line of poetry, and other cherished things of
art so often bring you into close communion with myself.
But there is one thing that does it infallibly and
more than anything else: trees on a horizon, whether
plain or upland, standing against a cloudless blue sky&mdash;more
especially when there is a soft blue haze dimly palpitating
between. Strange, is it not? I only half indefinitely
myself know the cause of it. <i>One</i> cause certainly
is the sense of music there is in that aspect&mdash;possibly
also the fairness of an association so sympathetic with
some gracious memory of the past.</p>

<p class="pbq">P. S.&mdash;By-the-bye, have you noticed that my “Nocturne”
is in the July number of <i>Good Words</i>?</p>


<p class="p1">This poem was of special interest to me because it
had been written while I had played to him on the piano
one evening. It was in the summer of 1878 also that he
just met Mr. John Elder, whom I had known from childhood.
John was a graduate of Cambridge, a thinker
and man of fine tastes, and his new friend found a great
stimulus in the keen mind of the older man. Owing to
delicacy he could be but little in England, and till his
death in 1883 the two men corresponded regularly with
one another. From the letters of the younger man I
have selected one or two to illustrate the trend of his
mind at that date:</p>

<p class="pr5 p1"><span class="smcap">19 Albert St., Regent’s Park</span>,</p>
<p class="pr4">Oct., 1879.</p>

<p class="pn"><span class="smcap">My dear John</span>,</p>

<div class="pbq">

<p>Thanks for your welcome letter of 18th August. My
purpose, in my letter of May 7th, if I recollect rightly,
was to urge that Reason is sometimes transcended by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
Emotion&mdash;sufficiently often, that is to say, to prevent
philosophers from deriding the idea that a truth may
be reached emotionally now and again, quicker than by
the light of Reason. God may be beyond the veil of
mortal life, but I cannot see that he has given us any
definite revelation beyond what pure Deism teaches, viz.,
that there is a Power&mdash;certainly beneficent, most probably
eternal, possibly (in effect, if not in detail) omnipotent&mdash;who,
letting the breath of His being blow through
all created things, evolves the Ascidian into man, and
man into higher manifestations than are possible on
earth, and whose message and revelation to man is shown
forth in the myriad-paged volume of nature, and the
inherent yearning in every human soul for something
out of itself and yet of it. Of such belief, I may say that
I am.</p>

<p>But my mind is like a troubled sea, whereon the winds
of doubt blow continually, with waves of dead hopes
and religious beliefs washing far away behind, and nothing
before but the weary seeming of phantasmal shores.
At times this faith that I cherish comes down upon me
like the hushful fall of snow-flakes, calming and soothing
all into peace; and again, it may be, it appears as a dark
thunder-cloud, full of secret lightnings and portentous
mutterings. And, too, sometimes I seem to waken into
thought with a start, and to behold nothing but the blind
tyranny of pure materialism, and the unutterable sorrow
and hopelessness of life, and the bitter blackness
of the end, which is annihilation. But such phases are
generally transient, and, like a drowning man buffeting
the overwhelming waves, I can often rise above them
and behold the vastness and the Glory of the Light of
Other Life.</p>

<p>And this brings me to a question which is at present
troubling many others besides myself. I mean the
question of the immortality of the individual. I do not
know how you regard it yourself, but you must be aware
that the drift of modern thought is antagonistic to personal
immortality, and that many of our best and most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
intelligent thinking men and women abjure it as unworthy
of their high conception of Humanity....</p>

<p>But <i>is</i> Humanity all? Has Humanity fashioned itself
out of primal elements, arisen and marched down the
long, strange ways of Time&mdash;still marching, with eyes
fixed on some self-projected Goal&mdash;without ever a spiritual
breath blowing upon it, without ever the faintest
guidance of any divine hand, without ever a glance of
sorrowful and yearning but yet ineffably hopeful love
from some Being altogether beyond and transcending
it? Is it, can it be so? But in any case, whether with
the Nirvana of the follower of Buddha, the absorption
of the soul in the soul of God of the Deist and Theist,
or with the loss of the individual in the whole of the
Race of the Humanitarian, I cannot altogether agree.
It may be the “old Adam” of selfishness; it may be
poverty of highest feeling and insufficiency of intellectual
grasp; but I cannot embrace the belief in the extinction
of the individual....</p></div>

<div class="pbq">

<p>I am glad you like my short paper in the <i>Sectarian
Review</i> and I think that you understand my motive in
writing it. It is no unreasoning reverence that I advocate,
no “countenancing beliefs in worn-out superstitions,”
as you say; no mercy to the erring, but much
mercy to and sympathy with the deceived. I do not reverence
the Bible or the Christian Theology in <i>themselves</i>,
but for the beautiful spirituality which faintly
but ever and again breathes through them, like a vague
wind blowing through intricate forests; and so far I
reverence the recognition of this spiritual breath in the
worship of those whose views are so very different from
my own....</p>

<p>I have been writing a good deal lately&mdash;chiefly verse.
There is one thing which I am sure will interest you:
some time ago I wrote a sonnet called “Religion,” the
drift of which was to show the futility of any of the
great creeds <i>as</i> creeds, and two or three weeks ago<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
showed it to my friend Mr. Belford Bax. It seems to
have made considerable impression upon him, for, after
what he calls “having absorbed it,” he has set it to very
beautiful recitative music. There are some fine chords
in the composition, preluding the pathetic melody of the
finale; and altogether it has given me great pleasure.
But what specially interests me is that it is the first
time (as far as I am aware) of a sonnet in any language
having been set to music. The form of this kind
of verse is of course antagonistic to song-music, and
could only be rendered by recitative. Do you know of
any instance having occurred? The sonnet in question
will appear in <i>The Examiner</i> in a week or two.</p></div>

<p class="pph6 p1">Lo, in a dream, I saw a vast dim sea<br />
Whose sad waves broke upon a barren shore;<br />
The name of this wan sea was <i>Nevermore</i>,</p>
<p class="pph6">The land <i>The Past</i>, the shore <i>Futility</i>:</p>
<p class="pph6">Thereon I spied three mighty Shadows; three<br />
Weary and desolate Shades, of whom each wore<br />
A crown whereon was writ <i>Despair</i>. To me</p>
<p class="pph6">One spoke, and said, “Lo, I am He<br />
In whom the countless millions of the East</p>
<p class="pph6">Live, move, and hope. And all is vanity!”&mdash;<br />
And I knew Buddha. Then the next: “The least<br />
Am I, but once God’s mightiest Prophet-Priest”&mdash;</p>
<p class="pph6">So spake Mahomet. And then pitifully</p>
<p class="pph6">The third Shade moaned, “I am of Galilee!”</p>

<p class="pbq p1">I also enclose the record of a vision I had lately:</p>

<p class="pph6 p1">Lo, in that Shadowy place wherein is found<br />
The fruitage of the spirit men call dreams,<br />
I wander’d. Ever underneath pale gleams</p>
<p class="pph6">Of misty moonlight quivering all around,<br />
And ever by the banks of sedgy streams<br />
Swishing thro’ fallen rushes with slow sound</p>
<p class="pph6">A spirit walked beside me. From a mound,</p>
<p class="pph6">Rustling from poplar-leaves from top to base,</p>
<p class="pph6">Some bird I knew not shrilled a cry of dole,</p>
<p class="pph6">So bitter, I cried out to God for grace.<br />
Whereat he by me slackened from his pace,</p>
<p class="pph6">Turning upon me in my cold amaze<br />
And saying, “While the long years onward roll</p>
<p class="pph6">Thou shalt be haunted by this hateful face&mdash;“<br />

<p class="pbq">I may say in reference to the Religion of Humanity
that my sympathy with Comtism is only limited, and
that though I think it is and will yet be an instrument
of great good, I see nothing in it of essential savingness.
It is even in some of its ceremonial and practical details a
decided retrogression&mdash;at least so it seems to me&mdash;and
though I do not believe in a revealed God, I think such
a belief higher and more precious and morally as salutary
as a belief in abstract Humanity. Concrete humanity appeals
more to my sympathy when filled with the breath
of “God” than in its relation to its abstract Self. When
I write again I will endeavour to answer your question
as to whether I believe in a God or not. My friend, we
are all in the hollow of some mighty moulding Hand.
Every fibre in my body quivers at times with absolute
faith and belief, yet I do not say that I believe in “God”
when asked such a question by those whom I am conscious
misinterpret me. You have some lines of mine
called “The Redeemer”; they will hint something to you
of that belief which buoys my soul up in the ocean of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
love that surrounds it. It were well for the soul, if
annihilation rounds off the circle of life, to sink to final
forgetfulness in the sea of precious human love; but it
is far better if the soul can be borne along that sea of
wonder and glory to distant ever-expanding goals, transcending
in <i>love, glory, life</i> all that human imagination
ever conceived....</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER III</h2>

<p class="pch">EARLY DAYS IN LONDON</p>

<p>The most important influence in the early literary
career of the young poet was his friendship with Dante
Gabriel Rossetti. He gained not only a valued friend,
who introduced him to many of the well-known writers
of the time, but one who helped him in the development
of his art by sound, careful criticism and kindly encouragement.
His first acquaintance with the writings of
the painter-poet dated from the Autumn of 1879, when
on his birthday Miss Adelaide Elder had sent him a volume
of poems, an incident destined to have far-reaching
results. In 1899 he wrote to her:</p>


<p class="pn1"><span class="smcap">Dear Adelaide</span>,</p>

<div class="pbq">
<p>Do you know why I thought of you to-day particularly,
it being my birthday? For it was you who some
two and twenty years ago sent me on the 12th of September
a copy of a beautifully bound book by a poet with a
strange name and by me quite unknown&mdash;Dante Gabriel
Rossetti.</p>

<p>To that event it is impossible to trace all I owe, but
what is fairly certain is that, without it, the whole course
of my life might have been very different. For the book
not only influenced and directed me mentally at a crucial
period, but made me speak of it to an elderly friend
(Sir Noel Paton) through whom I was dissuaded from
going abroad on a career of adventure (I was going to
Turkey or as I vaguely put it, Asia) and through whom,
later, I came to know Rossetti himself&mdash;an event which
completely redirected the whole course of my life.</p>

<p>It would be strange to think how a single impulse of
a friend may thus have so profound a significance were
it not that to you and me there is nothing strange (in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
the sense of incredible) in the complex spiritual interrelation
of life. Looking back through all those years
I daresay we can now both see a strange and in much
inscrutable, but still recognisable, direction.</p></div>


<p class="p1">To quote his own words:</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“By the autumn of 1880 I was within sight of that
long and arduous career called the literary life. An
extraordinary good fortune met me at the outset, for,
through an introduction from Sir Noel Paton, I came to
know, and know intimately, Dante Gabriel Rossetti,
whose winsome personality fascinated me as much as
his great genius impressed me. Rossetti introduced me
to one who became my chief friend&mdash;the late Philip
Bourke Marston; and through Rossetti also I came to
know Mr. Theodore Watts, Mr. Swinburne, and others.
By the spring of 1881, I was in the literary world, and
in every phase of it, from the most Bohemian to the most
isolated.”</p>

<p class="p1">On the 1st of September, 1881, William Sharp presented
himself at the door of 16 Cheyne Walk. The
housekeeper explained that Mr. Rossetti could receive
no one. The importunate stranger persisted and stated
that it was of the highest importance that he should see
Mr. Rossetti and so impressed her that she not only
went to report to Mr. Rossetti but came back with orders
to admit him. On seeing his eager visitor, the poet-painter
naturally asked him what he wanted so urgently,
and his visitor answered promptly, “Only to shake
hands with you before you die!” “Well,” was the answer,
“I am in no immediate danger of dying, but you
may shake hands if you wish.”</p>

<p>The introduction from Sir Noel Paton was then tendered;
and thus began a friendship that grew to a deep
affectionate devotion on the side of the younger man.</p>

<p>Rossetti took him into the studio, and showed him the
paintings he had on his easels. The two which specially
impressed his visitor were “La Donna della Fenestra<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>,”
and “Dante’s Dream.” In a letter written to me when
I was in Italy, he describes the pictures as beautiful
colour harmonies, and continues:</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“After I had looked at it for a long time in happy
silence, Rossetti sat behind me in the shadow and read
me his translation of the poem from the <i>Vita Nuova</i>,
which refers to Dante’s Dream. Was it not kind of him
to give so much pleasure to one, a complete stranger?
I also saw several other paintings of extreme beauty,
but which I have no time to mention at present. He told
me to come again, and shortly before I left he asked me
for my address, and said that he would ask me to come
some evening to talk with him, and also to meet one or
two. This was altogether unexpected. Fancy having two
such men for <i>friends</i> as Sir Noel Paton and Dante
Gabriel Rossetti! I went out in a dream. The outside
world was altogether idealised. I was in the golden age
again. To calm myself, I went and leant over Chelsea
Embankment, where there were many people as there
was a regatta going on. But, though conscious of external
circumstances, I was not in London. The blood of
the South burned in my veins, the sky was a semi-tropical
one: the river rushing past was not the Thames, but
the Tiber; the granite embankment was a marble aqueduct,
with vines laden with ripe fruit covering it with a
fragrant veil: citrons and pomegranates were all
around. Dark passionate eyes of the South met mine;
the dreamy sweetness of a strange tongue sang an ineffably
delicious song through and through my soul: I
sank into the utmost realms of reverie, and drank a
precious draught of alien life for only too brief a space.
Not De Quincey in the mystic rapture of opium, not Mohammed
in his vision of Paradise, drank deeper of the
ineffable wine of the Supreme and Unattainable.”</p>

<p class="p1">It was several weeks before the much-hoped-for invitation
came, and the recipient was feeling so ill that he
was hardly in a condition to take full advantage of it,
and feared he had made a bad impression on his host.
The following morning he wrote:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>

<p class="pn1"><span class="smcap">My dear Sir</span>,</p>

<div class="pbq">
<p>I hope you will not consider me ungrateful for the
pleasure you gave me last night because I outwardly
showed so little appreciation&mdash;but I was really so unwell
from cold and headache that it was the utmost I
could do to listen coherently. But though, otherwise,
I look back gratefully to the whole evening I especially
recall with pleasure the few minutes in which now and
again you read. I have never heard such a beautiful
reader of verse as yourself, and if I had not felt&mdash;well,
shy&mdash;I should have asked you to go on reading. Voice,
and tone, and expression, all were in perfect harmony&mdash;and
although I have much else to thank you for, allow
me to thank you for the pleasure you have given me in
this also.</p>

<p>I enclose 4 or 5 poems taken at random from my MSS.
Two or three were written two or three years ago. That
called the “Dancer” is modelled on your beautiful
“Card-Dealer.”</p>

<p>I have also to thank you for your kind criticisms: and
hope that you do not consider my aspirations and daring
hopes as altogether in vain. Despair comes sometimes
upon me very heavily, but I have not yet lost heart.</p></div>

<p class="p1">On the 23d of February he wrote to Mrs. Caird:</p>

<p class="pn1"><span class="smcap">Dear Mona</span>.</p>

<div class="pbq">

<p>Was unable after all to resume my letter on Friday
night. On Friday morning I had a note from Rossetti
wanting me to come again and dine with him&mdash;this time
alone, I was glad to find. I spent a most memorable
evening, and enjoyed myself more than I can tell. We
dined together in free and easy manner in his studio,
surrounded by his beautiful paintings and studies.
Then, and immediately after dinner he told me things of
himself, personal reminiscences, with other conversation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
about the leading living painters and poets. Then he
talked to me about myself, and my manuscripts&mdash;a few of
which he had seen. Then personal and other matters
again, followed, to my great delight (as Rossetti is a
most beautiful reader) by his reading to me a great part
of the as yet unpublished sonnets which go to form “The
House of Life.” Some of them were splendid, and
seemed to me finer than those published&mdash;more markedly
intellectual, I thought. This took up a long time,
which passed most luxuriously for me....</p>

<p>He has been so kind to me every way: and this time
he gave me two most valuable and welcome introductions&mdash;one
to Philip Bourke Marston, the man whose genius
is so wonderful, considering he has been blind from his
birth&mdash;and the other to his brother Mr. Michael Rossetti,
to whom, however, he had already kindly spoken
about me. I am to go when I wish to the latter’s literary
re-unions, where I shall make the acquaintance of
some of our leading authors and authoresses. Did I
tell you that the last time I dined at Rossetti’s house he
gave me a copy of his poems, with something from himself
written on the fly-leaf? On that occasion I also met
Theodore Watts, the well-known critic of <i>The Athenaeum</i>.
It is so strange to be on intimate terms with a
man whom a short time ago I looked on as so far off.
Perhaps, dear friend, when you come to stay with Elizabeth
and myself in the happy days which I hope are in
store for us all, you will “pop” into quite a literary
circle!... I was sure, also, you would enjoy the <i>Life
of Clifford</i> in “Mod: Thought.” What a splendid man
he was: a true genius, yet full of the joy of life, sociable,
fun-loving, genial, and in every way a gentleman. I
was reading one of his books lately, and was struck with
the sympathetic spirit he showed toward what to him
meant nothing&mdash;Christianity. I wish we had more men
like him. There is another man for whom I think I have
an equal admiration, though of a different order in one
sense&mdash;Dr. Martineau. Have you read anything of his?</p>

<p>On Wednesday evening next I am going to a Spiritual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
Séance, by the best mediums&mdash;which I am looking forward
to with great curiosity....</p>

<p>Besides verse, I am writing a Paper just now on “Climate
in Relation to the Influences of Art,” and going on
with one or two other minor things. There now, I have
told you all about myself....</p></div>

<p class="pr5 reduct">Your friend and comrade,</p>
<p class="pr4 reduct"><span class="smcap">Will</span>.</p>

<p class="p1">He submitted several poems to Rossetti who had suggested
that if he had a suitable sonnet it might be included
in Hall Caine’s <i>Century of Sonnets</i>. Rossetti’s
acknowledgment contained an adverse criticism on the
Sonnet sent, softened by an invitation to the younger
man to go again to see him.</p>


<p class="pr4 p1 reduct">Saturday.</p>

<p class="pn"><span class="smcap">Dear Mr. Rossetti</span>,</p>

<div class="pbq">
<p>Thanks for your kind invitation to Philip and myself
for Monday night&mdash;which we are both glad to accept.
I found him in bed this morning on my way to the city&mdash;but
had no scruple in waking him as I knew what pleasure
your message would give. We both thank you also
for promising to put us up at night.</p>

<p>I infer from your letter that you do not think <i>The
Two Realities</i> good enough to send to Caine: and
though of course sorry, I acquiesce in your judgment. I
know that none of my best work is in sonnet-form, and
that I have less mastery over the latter than any other
form of verse. But I will try to improve my deficiencies
in this way by acting up to your suggestions. You see,
I have never had the advantage of such a severe critic
as you before. For instance, I have received praise
from many on account of a sonnet you once saw (one
of a series on “Womanhood”) called “Approaching
Womanhood”&mdash;which I enclose herewith&mdash;wishing you
to tell me <i>how</i> it is poor and what I might have made of
it instead. As I am writing from the city I have no
others by me (but indeed you have been bothered sufficiently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
already) but will try and give one from memory&mdash;which
I hastily dashed down one day in the office.</p>

<p>Looking forward to Monday night,</p></div>

<p class="pr6 reduct">Yours ever sincerely,</p>
<p class="pr4 reduct"><span class="smcap">William Sharp</span>.</p>

<p class="p1">Eventually the Sonnets were written that satisfied his
critic and were included in Hall Caine’s Anthology.</p>

<p>About this time also he was attempting a poem relating
to an imaginary episode in the early life of Christ.
To me it seemed a mistake, and I urged him to consult
Mr. Rossetti, who replied as follows:</p>

<p class="pr4 p1 reduct">Thursday, Jan., 1880.</p>

<p class="pn"><span class="smcap">My dear Sharp</span>,</p>

<p class="pbq">I am quite unable to advise you on so abstruse a point.
Strange to say, I can conceive no higher Ideal than the
Christ we know; and I judge it to be very rash to lower
in poetry (to the apprehension of many beautiful minds)
that Ideal, by any assumption to decide a point respecting
it which it is not possible to <i>decide</i>, whichever way
belief or even conviction may tend.</p>

<p class="pbq">I did not gather fully the relation of the Wandering
Jew to your poem. If the very Jew in question, how is
he to know of the development of humanity before his
time? That he is a symbol of course I understand; but
the balance between person and symbol should be clearly
determined. I hope you may enjoy yourself in such
good company, and am ever,</p>

<p class="pr6 reduct">Sincerely yours,</p>
<p class="pr4 reduct"><span class="smcap">D. G. Rossetti</span>.</p>

<p class="p1">Sir Noel Paton had given his younger countryman an
introduction also to his old friend Mrs. Craik (author of
John Halifax) who, it happened, was P. B. Marston’s godmother.
She had a house in Kent, at Shortlands, and
to it she on several occasions invited the two young
poets. During one of these days, in the late summer,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
they went for a drive through the green lanes, when suddenly
there came on a thunderstorm. The carriage was
shut up, but there was no way of protecting the occupant
of the box seat. So that Philip should come to no harm
the younger man took the box seat and got thoroughly
wet. On reaching the house he refused many suggestions
to have his clothes dried, and went back to town
that evening in his damp garments. A violent cold ensued,
which he was unable to throw off. He was out of
health, ill-nourished, owing to his slender means, and
overworked. That summer my mother had taken a cottage
in South Wales, on the estuary near Portmadoc,
and my cousin came to spend his holidays with us. A
weary delicate creature arrived, but he was sure that a
bathe or two in the salt water would soon cure him. Alas,
instead of that within a few days he was laid low with
rheumatic fever, and for four weeks my mother and I
nursed him and it was the end of September before he
could go back to town. That autumn my mother let her
house for six months and decided to winter in Italy with
her daughters. Although there was much that was
alluring in the prospect I was very greatly worried at
leaving London, for my poet was so weak and delicate,
and I distrusted his notions of taking care of himself.
On the 13th December he wrote to me:</p>

<p class="pr4 p1 reduct">Monday, 13: 12: 80.</p>

<p class="pbq">“I spent such a pleasant evening on Saturday. I went
round to Francillon’s house about 8 o’clock, and spent
about an hour there with him and Julian Hawthorne.
Then we walked down to Covent Garden, and joined the
‘Oasis’ Club&mdash;where we met about 30 or so other literary
men and artists, including the D. Christie Murray
I so much wished to meet, and whom I like very much.
We spent a very pleasant while a decidedly ‘Bohemian’
night, and after we broke up I walked home with
Francillon, Julian Hawthorne, and Murray. Hawthorne
and myself are to be admitted members at the next
meeting.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1">He has described his friendship with the blind poet in
his Introduction to a Selection of Marston’s poems published
in the Canterbury Series:</p>

<p>“I was spending an evening with Rossetti, when I
chanced to make some reference to Marston’s poetry.
Finding that I did not know the blind poet and that I
was anxious to meet him, Rossetti promised to bring us
together. I remember that I was fascinated by him at
once&mdash;his manner, his personality, his conversation.
‘There is a kind of compensation,’ he remarked to me
once, ‘in the way that new friendships arise to brighten
my life as soon as I am bowled over by some great
loss.’”</p>

<p>Just before Christmas, William wrote:</p>

<p class="pn1"><span class="smcap">Dear Mr. Rossetti</span>,</p>

<div class="pbq">
<p>... I wished very much to show you two poems I had
written in the earlier half of this year, and now send
them by the same post. The one entitled “Motherhood”
I think the better on the whole. It was written to give
expression to the feeling I had so strongly of the
beauty and sacredness of Motherhood in itself, and
how this is the same, in degree, all through creation:
the poem is accordingly in three parts&mdash;the first dealing
with an example of Motherhood in the brute creation,
the second with a savage of the lowest order,
and the third with a civilised girl-woman of the highest
type.</p>

<p>The other&mdash;“The Dead Bridegroom”&mdash;is more purely
an “art” poem. After reading it, you will doubtless
recognise the story, which I believe is true. Swinburne
(I understand) told it to one or two, and Meredith embodied
it in a short ballad. Philip Marston told me the
story one day, and, it having taken a great hold upon
me, the accompanying poem was the result. After I had
finished and read it to Philip, it took strong hold of his
imagination also&mdash;and so he also began a poem on the
same subject, treating it differently, however, and employing
the <i>complete</i> details of the story, instead of, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
I have done, stopping short at the lover’s death, and
is still unfinished.</p>

<p>It is in great part owing to his generously enthusiastic
praise that I now send these for your inspection; but
also because much of what may be good in them is owing
to your gratefully remembered personal influence and
kindness, as well as your own beautiful work.”</p></div>

<p class="p1">His kindly critic answered:</p>

<p class="pr4 p1 reduct">Jan., 1881.</p>

<p class="pn"><span class="smcap">My dear Sharp</span>,</p>

<div class="pbq">
<p>I have only this evening read your poems, and am
quite amazed at the vast gain in distinction and reality
upon anything I had seen of yours before. I read
“Motherhood” first and think it best on the whole. It is
full of fine things and strange variety. “The Dead Bridegroom”
is less equal, but some touches are extremely fine.
The close after the crisis strikes me as done with a certain
difficulty and wants some pointing. As a narrative
poem, I do not yet think it quite distinct enough, though
it always rises at the right moment. The execution of
your work needs some reform in detail. The adjectives,
especially when monosyllabic, are too crowded. There
are continual assonances of <i>ings</i>, <i>ants</i>, <i>ows</i>, etc., midway
in the lines. However, the sonorousness is sometimes
striking and the grip of the phrases complete at its best.
I am sure you have benefited much by association with
Philip Marston, though I do not mean to say that such
things as these can have their mainspring elsewhere
than in native gift.</p>

<p>I will keep the poems a few days yet and then return
them.</p></div>

<p class="pr6 reduct">Yours sincerely,</p>
<p class="pr4 reduct"><span class="smcap">D. G. Rossetti.</span></p>

<p class="p1">A letter from the younger poet, written a few days
later, reached me in Rome:</p>

<p class="pr4 p1 reduct">24: 1: 81.</p>

<p class="pbq">“Well, last Friday was a ‘red-letter’ day to me. I
went to Rossetti’s at six, dined about 7.30, and stayed
there all night. We had a jolly talk before dinner, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
then Shields the painter came in and stayed till about 11
o’clock: after that Rossetti read me all his unpublished
poems, some of which are magnificent&mdash;talked, etc.&mdash;and
we did not go to bed till about three in the morning. I
did not go to the Bank next day, as I did not feel well:
however, I wrote hard at poetry, etc., all day till seven
o’clock, managing to keep myself up with tea. I was
quite taken aback by the extent of Rossetti’s praise. He
said he did not say much in his letter because writing
so often looks ‘gushing’ but he considered I was able
to take a foremost place among the younger poets of
the day&mdash;and that many signs in my writings pointed
to a first-class poet&mdash;that the opening of ‘The Dead
Bridegroom’ was worthy of Keats&mdash;that ‘Motherhood’
was in every sense of the word a memorable poem&mdash;that
I must have great productive power, and broad and
fine imagination&mdash;and many other things which made me
very glad and proud.”</p>

<p class="p1">“The Dead Bridegroom” was never published, but in a
letter to a friend who raised objections to the treatment
of the poem “Motherhood”&mdash;he wrote in explanation:</p>

<div class="pbq">
<p class="p1">“You seem to think my object in writing was to describe
the actual initial act of Motherhood&mdash;whereas
such acts were only used incidentally to the idea. I
entirely agree with you in thinking such a <i>motif</i> unfit for
poetic treatment&mdash;and more, I think the choice of such
would be in very bad taste and wanting in true delicacy.
My aim was something very far from this&mdash;and what
made me see you had not grasped it were the words&mdash;‘Besides,
is not your type of civilised woman degraded
by being associated with the savage and the wild
beast?’</p>

<p>“Of course, what I was endeavouring to work out
was just the opposite of this. ‘Motherhood’ was written
from a deep conviction of the beauty of the state
of Motherhood itself, of the holy, strangely similar bond
of union it gave to all created things, and how it, as it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
were, forged the links whereby the chain of life reached
unbroken from the polyp depths we do see to the God
whom we do not see. Looking at it as I did, I saw it
transfigured to the Seal of Unity: I saw the bestial life
touch the savage, and the latter’s low existence edge
complete nobility of womanhood, as&mdash;in the spirit&mdash;I
see this last again merge into fuller spiritual periods
beyond the present sphere of human life. In embodying
this idea I determined to take refuge in no vague transcendentalism,
or from any false feeling shirk what I
knew to be noble in its mystic wonder and significance:
and I came to the conclusion that the philosophic idea
could be best embodied and made apparent by moulding
it into three typical instances of motherhood, representing
the brute, the savage, and the civilised woman. From
this point of view, I considered the making choice of the
initial act of motherhood&mdash;of birth&mdash;entirely justifiable,
and beyond reach of reproach of impurity, or even unfitness.
As to the artistic working out of these typical
<i>motives</i>, I gave to the first glow and colour, to the second
mystery and weirdness, to the third what dignity
and solemnity I could.</p>

<p>“These were my aims and views, and I have not yet
seen anything to make me change them....</p>

<p>“So much for ‘Motherhood.’ As to ‘The Dead Bridegroom,’
I quite admit that the advisability of choosing
such subjects is a very debatable one. It is the only
one of mine (in my opinion) which could incur the
charge of doubtful ‘fitness.’ As a poem, moreover, it
is inferior in workmanship to ‘Motherhood.’”</p></div>


<p class="p1">To E. A. S.:</p>

<p class="pr4 p1 reduct">“4: 2: 81.</p>

<p class="pbq">“I have written one of my best poems (in its own way)
since writing you last. It was on Tuesday night: I did
not get back till about seven o’clock, and began at once
to write. Your letter came an hour or so afterward but
it had to lie waiting till after midnight, when I finished,
having written and polished a complete poem of thirty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
verses in that short time. It is a ballad. The story
itself is a very tragic one. Perhaps the kind of verse
would be clear to you if I were to quote a verse as a
specimen:</p>

<p class="ppq6 p1">“And I saw thy face wax flush’d, then pale,<br />
And thy lips grow blue like black-ice hail,<br />
With eyes on fire with the soul’s fierce bale,</p>
<p class="ppn10">Son of Allan!</p>
<p class="ppq6">“I may have been pale, and may be red&mdash;<br />
But this night shall one lie white and dead.</p>
<p class="ppn10">(O Mother of God! whose eyes</p>
<p class="ppn6">Watch men lie dead ’neath midnight skies.)”</p>

<div class="pbq">
<p class="p1">“Both story and verse I invented myself: and I think
you will think it equal to anything I have done in power.
It was a good lot to do at a sitting, wasn’t it? I will
read it to you when you come home again.... I enjoyed
my stay with Rossetti immensely. We did not
breakfast till one o’clock on Tuesday&mdash;pretty late,
wasn’t it? (I told you I had a holiday, didn’t I?) He
told me again that he considered ‘Motherhood’ fit to
take the foremost place in recent poetry. He has such
a fine house, though much of it is shut up, and full of
fine things: he showed me some of it that hardly any one
ever sees. He has asked me to come to him again next
Sunday. Isn’t it splendid?&mdash;and ar’n’t you glad for my
sake? He told Philip that he thought I “had such a
sweet genial happy nature.” Isn’t it nice to be told of
that. My intense delight in little things seems also to
be a great charm to him&mdash;whether in a stray line of
verse, or some new author, or a cloudlet, or patch of
blue sky, or chocolate-drops, etc., etc. Have you noticed
this in me? I am half gratified and half amused to hear
myself so delineated, as I did not know my nature was
so palpable to comparative strangers. And now I am
going to crown my horrid vanity by telling you that Mrs.
Garnet met Philip a short time ago, and asked after the
health of his friend, the “handsome young poet!”
There now, amn’t I horridly conceited? (N. B.&mdash;I’m
pleased all the same, you know!)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span></p>

<p>“I wrote a little lyric yesterday which is one of the
most musical I have ever done. To-day, I was ‘took’
by a writing mood in the midst of business hours, and
despite all the distracting and unpoetical surroundings,
managed to hastily jot down the accompanying lyric. It
is the general end of young <i>unknowing</i> love....</p>

<p>“I had a splendid evening last night, and Rossetti read
a lot more of his latest work. Splendid as his published
work is, it is surpassed by what has yet to be published.
The more I look into and hear his poems the more I am
struck with the incomparable power and depth of his
genius&mdash;his almost magical perfection and mastery of
language&mdash;his magnificent spiritual strength and subtlety.
He read some things last night, lines in which
almost took my breath away. No sonnet-writer in the
past has equalled him, and it is almost inconceivable to
imagine any one doing so in the future. His influence
is already deep and strong, but I believe in time to come
he will be looked back to as we now look to Shakespeare,
to Milton, and in one sense to Keats. I can find no language
to express my admiration of his supreme gifts,
and it is with an almost painful ecstasy that I receive
from time to time fresh revelations of his intellectual,
spiritual, and artistic splendour. I fancy one needs to
be an actual poet to feel this to the full, but every one,
however dim and stagnant or coldly intellectual his or
her soul, must feel more or less the marvellous beauty
of this wedding of the spirit of emotional thought and
the spirit of language, and the child thereof&mdash;divine,
perfect expression. Our language in Rossetti’s hands
is more solemn than Spanish, more majestic than Latin,
deeper than German, sweeter than Italian, more divine
than Greek. I know of nothing comparable to it. He
told me to call him Rossetti and not ‘Mr. Rossetti,’ as
disparity in age disappears in close friendship, wasn’t
it nice of him? It makes me both very proud and humble
to be so liked and praised by the greatest master in
England&mdash;proud to have so far satisfied his fastidious
critical taste and to have excited such strong belief in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
my powers, and humble in that I fall so far short of him
as to make the gulf seem impassable.”</p></div>

<p class="p1">In Italy I was making a careful study of the old masters
in painting, and found that my correspondent took
but lukewarm interest in my enthusiasm. Until that date
he had had little opportunity of studying Painting;
and at no time did the <i>cinquecento</i> and earlier painters
really attract him. I regretted his indifference,
and asked him, banteringly, if his dislike extended
equally to the early masters of the pen and to those
of the brush.</p>

<p>He replied: “You ask me, if I dislike the Old Masters
of Poetry as much as I do those of Painting? and I reply
Certainly not, but at the same time the comparison
is not fair. Most of the old poets are not only poets of
their time but have special beauties at the present day,
and can be read with as much or almost as much pleasure
now as centuries ago. Their imagination, their
scope, their detail is endless. On the other hand the Old
Masters of Painting are (to me, of course, and speaking
generally) utterly uninteresting in their subjects, in
the way they treat them, and in the meaning that is
conveyed. If it were not for the richness and beauty
of their colour I would never go into another gallery
<i>from pleasure</i>, but colour alone could not always satisfy
me. But take the ‘Old Masters’ of Poetry! Homer
of Greece, Virgil and Dante of Italy, Theocritus of
Sicily, and in England Chaucer, Shakespeare, Ben Jonson,
Webster, Ford, Massinger, Marlowe, Milton!</p>

<p>“The poetry of these men is beautiful in itself apart
from the relation they bear to their times. We may not
care for Dryden (though I do) or Prior or Cowley, because
in the verse of these latter there is nothing to
withstand the ages, nothing that rises above their times.
In looking at Rubens, or Leonardo da Vinci, or Fra Angelico,
we must school ourselves to admiration by saying
‘How wonderful for their time, what a near attempt
at a perspective, what a near success in drawing nature&mdash;external<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
and human!’ Would you, or any one, care
for a painting of Angelico’s if executed in exactly the
same style and in equally soft and harmonious colours
at the present day? Could you enjoy and enter into it
apart from its relation to such-and-such a period of
early Christian Art? It may be possible, but I doubt it.
On the other hand take up the Old Masters of Poetry
and judge them by the present high standard. Take up
Homer&mdash;who has his width and space? Dante&mdash;who
has his fiery repressed intensity? Theocritus, who has
sung sweeter of meadows and summer suns and flowers?
Chaucer&mdash;who is as delicious now as in the latter part
of the fourteenth century! Shakespeare&mdash;who was, is,
and ever shall be the supreme crowned lord of verse!&mdash;Take
up one of the comparatively speaking minor lights
of the Elizabethan era. Does Jonson with his ‘Every
Man in his Humour,’ or his ‘Alchemist,’ does Webster
with his ‘Duchess of Malfi,’ does Ford with his ‘Lover’s
Melancholy,’ does Massinger, with his ‘Virgin
Martyr,’ do Beaumont and Fletcher with their ‘Maid’s
Tragedy,’ does Marlowe with his ‘Life and Death of
Dr. Faustus,’ pall upon us? Have we ever to keep before
us the fact that they lived so many generations or
centuries ago?</p>

<p>“I never tire of that wonderful, tremendous, magnificent
epoch in literature&mdash;the age of the Elizabethan
dramatists.</p>

<p>“Despite the frequent beauty of much that followed I
think the genius of Poetry was of an altogether inferior
power and order (excepting Milton) until once again
it flowered forth anew in Byron, in Coleridge, in Keats,
and in Shelley! These two last names, what do they not
mean! Since then, after a slight lapse, Poetry has
soared to serener heights again, and Goethe, Victor
Hugo, Tennyson, and Browning have moulded new generations,
and men like Rossetti, Swinburne, Morris,
Marston, Longfellow, and others have helped to make
still more exquisitely fair the Temple of Human Imagination.
Men like Joaquin Miller and Whitman are the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
south and north winds that soothe or stir the leaves of
thought surrounding it.</p>

<p>“We are on the verge of another great dramatic epoch&mdash;more
subtle and spiritual if not grander in dimensions
than that of the sixteenth century. I hope to God I live
to see the sunrise which must follow the wayward lights
of the present troubled dawn....</p>

<p>“On Monday evening (from eight till two) I go again
as usual to Marston’s. I called at his door on my way
here this afternoon and left a huge bouquet of wallflowers,
with a large yellow heart of daffodils, to cheer
him up. He is passionately fond of flowers....”</p>

<p class="p2">That winter, despite his continued delicacy, was full
of interest to William, who had always a rare capacity
for throwing himself into the enjoyment of the moment,
whatever it might be, or into the interests of others and
dismissing from his mind all personal worries. No matter
how depressed he might be, when with friends he
could shake himself free from the thraldom of the black
clouds and let his natural buoyant spirit have full play.
His genial sunny manner, his instinctive belief in and
reliance on an equal geniality in others assured him
many a welcome.</p>

<p>Among the literary houses open to him were those of
Mr. and Mrs. William Rossetti, Miss Christina Rossetti,
Mr. and Mrs. William Bell Scott, Mr. and Mrs. Francillon,
Mr. Robert Browning, and Mr. Theodore Watts.
Mr. and Mrs. George Robinson, whose daughter, Mary,
distinguished herself among the poets of her generation,
were especially good to him. Among artists whose
studios he frequented were Mr. Ford Madox Brown,
Mr. William Morris and Mr. Holman Hunt, and Sir
Frederick Leighton; and among his intimate friends he
counted Mathilde Blind, the poet, Louise Bevington,
Mrs. Louise Chandler Moulton, Belford Bax and others.</p>

<p>There was a reverse side to the picture however. His
desire and effort not to identify himself&mdash;in his original
work, with any set of writers, or phase of literary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
expression, tended to make him of no account in the
consideration of some of his fellow writers. His was
a slow development, and while he gained greatly in
the technical knowledge of his art through the wise and
careful advice of Rossetti, the sensitive taste of Philip
Marston, the more severe criticism of Theodore Watts,
he felt he had a definite thing to say, a definite word of
his own to express sooner or later. It was long before
this finally shaped its utterance, and in the interval he
experimented in many directions, studied various methods&mdash;and
of course to make a livelihood wrote many
“pot-boilers”&mdash;always hoping that he would ultimately
“find himself.” Unquestionably, with his nature&mdash;which
vibrated so sensitively to everything that was beautiful
in nature and life, and had in it so much of exuberance,
of optimism&mdash;the severe grind for the bare necessities
of life, the equally severe criticism that met his early
efforts, proved an invaluable-schooling to him. The
immediate result, however, was that his “other self,”
the dreaming psychic self, slept for a time, or at any
rate was in abeyance. “William Sharp” gradually
dominated, and before long he was accepted generally
as literary critic and later as art critic also. So complete,
apparently, for a time, was this divorce between
the two radical strains in him, that only a few of his intimates
suspected the existence of the sensitive, delicate,
feminine side of him that he buried carefully out of
sight, and as far as possible out of touch with the current
of his literary life in London where at no time did
the “Fiona Macleod” side of his nature gain help or
inspiration.</p>

<p>Just as of old, when in Glasgow, he had wandered in
the city and beyond it, and made acquaintances with all
sorts and conditions of men and women, so, too, did he
now wander about London, especially about the neighbourhood
of “The Pool” which offered irresistible attractions
and experiences to him. These he touched on
later in “Madge o’ the Pool” and elsewhere. I remember
he told me that rarely a day passed in which he did not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
try to imagine himself living the life of a woman, to see
through her eyes, and feel and view life from her standpoint,
and so vividly that “sometimes I forget I am not
the woman I am trying to imagine.” The following description
of him, at this date, is taken from a letter
quoted in Mrs. Janvier’s article on “Fiona Macleod and
her Creator” in <i>The North American Review</i>.</p>

<p>“You ask about our acquaintance with Willie Sharp.
Yes, we knew him well in the days when we all were gay
and young.... He was a very nice-looking amiable
young fellow whom every one liked, very earnest with
great notions of his own mission as regards Poetry,
which he took <i>very</i> seriously. He used to have the saving
grace of fun&mdash;which kept him sweet and wholesome&mdash;otherwise
he might have fallen into the morbid set.”</p>

<p>Unfortunately, I have very few letters or notes that
illustrate the light gay side of his nature&mdash;boyish, whimsical,
mischievous, with rapid changes of mood. Others
saw more of it at this period than I; for to me he came
for sympathy in his work and difficulties; to others he
went for gaiety and diversion, and to them he made light
of his constant delicacy; so that the more serious side of
his life was usually presented to me&mdash;and naturally our
most unpromising prospects and our long engagement
were not matters to inspirit either of us.</p>

<p>At the end of August in that year his connection with
the Bank of the City of Melbourne ceased. That his
services were scarcely valuable to his employers may be
gathered from the manner and reason of his dismissal.
He has himself told the story:</p>

<p>“I did not take very kindly to the business, and my
employers saw it. One day I was invited to interview
the Principal. He put it very diplomatically, said he
didn’t think the post suited me (I agreed), and finally
he offered me the option of accepting an agency in some
out-of-the-way place in Australia, or quitting the London
service. ‘Think it over,’ he said, ‘and give us your
answer to-morrow.’ I think I might have given him my
answer there and then. Next morning the beauty of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
early summer made an irresistible appeal to me. I had
not heard the cuckoo that season, so I resolved to forget
business for the day, seek the country, and hear the
cuckoo; and I had a very happy time, free from everybody,
care, and worry. Next day I was called in to see
the Principal. ‘I should have sent word&mdash;busy mail
day,’ he said. ‘Was I ill?’ he asked. ‘No,’ I replied,
and explained the true cause of my absence. ‘That’s
scarcely business,’ he said. ‘We can’t do with one who
puts the call of the cuckoo before his work.’ However,
his offer still held. What was I to do? I left the
bank.”</p>

<p>During the intervening months efforts to find other
work resulted through the kindness of Mr. George Lillie
Craik in a temporary post held for six months in the
Fine Art Society’s Gallery in Bond Street. It was the
proposal of the Directors to form a section dealing with
old German and English Engravings and Etchings, and
that William should be put in charge of it; and that
meanwhile, during the six months, he should make a special
study of the subject, learn certain business details
to make him more efficient. The work and the prospect
were a delightful change after the distasteful grind at
the Bank, and he threw himself into the necessary studies
with keen relish.</p>

<p>In the autumn he spent two months in Scotland, visiting
his mother, and other relatives, Mr. W. Bell Scott,
and his old friend Sir Noel Paton.</p>

<p>From Lanarkshire he wrote in September to me and
to Rossetti.</p>

<p class="p1">To E. A. S.:</p>

<p class="pr4 p1 reduct"><span class="smcap">Lesmahagow</span>, Sept., 1881.</p>

<p class="pbq">... Yesterday I spent some hours in a delicious ramble
over the moors and across a river toward a distant
fir wood, where I lay down for a time, beside the whispering
waters, seeing nothing but a semicircle of pines,
a wall of purple moorland, the brown water gurgling
and splashing and slowly moving over the mossy stones,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
and above a deep cloudless blue sky&mdash;and hearing nothing
but the hum of a dragonfly, the summery sound of
innumerable heather-bees, and the occasional distant
bleat of a sheep or sudden call of a grouse. I lay there
in a kind of trance of enjoyment&mdash;half painful from intensity.
I drank in not only the beauty of what I have
just described, but also every little and minute thing
that crossed my vision&mdash;a cluster of fir-needles hanging
steel-blue against the deeper colour of the sky, a wood-dove
swaying on a pine-bough like a soft gray and purple
blossom, a white butterfly clinging to a yellow blossom
heavy with honey, a ray of sunlight upon a bunch
of mountain-ash berries making their scarlet glow with
that almost terrible red which is as the blood of God in
the sunsets one sometimes sees, a dragonfly poised like
a flame arrested in its course, a little beetle stretching its
sharded wings upon a gray stone, a tiny blue morsel of a
floweret between two blades of grass looking up with, I
am certain, a <i>sense</i> of ecstatic happiness to the similar
skies above&mdash;all these and much more I drank in with
mingled pain and rejoicing. At such times I seem to
become a part of nature&mdash;the birds seem when they
sing to say things in a no longer unfamiliar speech&mdash;nor
do they seem too shy to approach quite close to me.
Even bees and wasps I do not brush away when they
light upon my hands or face, and they never sting me,
for I think they know that I would not harm them. I
feel at these rare and inexpressibly happy times as a
flower must feel after morning dew when the sun comes
forth in his power, as a pine tree when a rising wind
makes its boughs quiver with melodious pain, as a wild
wood-bird before it begins to sing, its heart being too
full for music.... O why weren’t you there?</p>


<p class="pr4 p1 reduct">10th Sept., 1881.</p>

<p class="pn"><span class="smcap">My dear Rossetti</span>,</p>

<div class="pbq">
<p>Where I most enjoy myself is along the solitary banks
of the Nithan: it is a true mountain stream, now rushing
along in broken falls, now rippling over shallows of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
exquisite golden-brown hues&mdash;now slipping with slow
perfect grace of motion under the overhanging boughs
of willow, pine, or mountain-ash&mdash;and ever and again
resting in deep dark linns and pools in deliciously
dreamful fashion, the only signs of life being a silver
flash from its depths as some large trout or grilse stirs
from the shelter of mottled boulders banking the sides,
or when a dragonfly like a living flame flashes backward
and forward after the gray gnats. Indeed, I never saw
such a place for dragonflies&mdash;I think there must be vast
treasures of rubies and emeralds under these lonely
moors, and that somehow the precious stones dissolve
and become permeated with the spirit of life, and rise
up living green fires or crimson and purple flames to
flash upon the unseen hill-winds instead of upon a woman’s
bosom or in the Holy of Holies in an idolater’s
temple....</p>

<p>After the gloaming has dreamed itself into night the
banks and woods along the stream seem to become a part
of a weird faeryland. The shadows are simply wonderful.
White owls come out and flit about on silent
ghostly wings with weird uncanny cries, and bats begin
to lead a furiously active existence. The other night I
was quite startled by seeing a perfectly white animal
slowly approaching me: it looked remarkably like the
ghost of a fox or wild-cat, but I am afraid it was only a
white hare.</p>

<p>So much for my surroundings. As for the few people
hereabout they are all charmingly of the old time.
After dinner, and while the claret, port, and sherry (the
latter, oh so brandied!) are in process of consumption,
large toddy goblets with silver spoon-ladles and smaller
tumblers are handed round to ladies and gentlemen alike.
Then come the large silver flagon with the hot water, the
bowl with the strictly symmetrical lumps of sugar, three
of which go to this large tumbler, and the cut crystal
decanter of pure Glenlivet. The custom has great advantages,
but it certainly does not conduce to the safe
driving of the dogcart home again.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER IV</h2>

<p class="pch">THE DEATH OF ROSSETTI</p>

<p>The Directors of The Fine Art Society decided finally
not to organise the special department of Engravings of
which William Sharp hoped to take charge, therefore his
engagement fell through and he was thrown on his own
resources. The outlook was very serious, for he was
still practically unknown to editors and publishers; and
during the following two years he had a hard fight with
circumstances. No post of any kind turned up for him
and he had to depend solely on his pen, and for many
months was practically penniless; and many a time the
only food he could afford, after a meagre breakfast, was
hot chestnuts bought from men in the street.</p>

<p>I do not care to dwell on those days; I could do so
little to help, and by common consent we hid the true
condition of things from his mother and mine. Nevertheless
we firmly believed in his “future”; that with
persistence and patience&mdash;and endurance&mdash;he would
“gain a footing”; that circumstances were pushing him
into the one career suited to him, even if the method
seemed too drastic at times.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span></p>

<p>He had already succeeded in having a poem accepted
occasionally by one or two Magazines and Weeklies. In
1879 <i>Good Words</i> published a poem entitled “Night,”
and in 1880 two Sonnets on Schubert’s “Am Meer.”
<i>The Examiner</i> printed some Sonnets and a poem of fifteen
lines. In 1881 he contributed a long poem on Victor
Hugo to <i>Modern Thought</i>, and in February of 1882
his Sonnet “Spring Wind” was accepted by the <i>Athenæum</i>
and it was afterward included in Hall Caine’s
Century of Sonnets. Early the following year he spent
a delightful week-end with Rossetti, at Birchington,
whence he wrote to me:</p>

<p class="pbqr p1">Feb. 13, 1882.</p>

<p class="pbq">“Just a line to tell you I am supremely content. Beautiful
sea views, steep ‘cavey’ cliffs, a delicious luxurious
house, and nice company. By a curious mistake I
got out at the wrong place on Sunday, and had a long walk
with my bag along the cliffs till I arrived rather tired
and hot at my destination. I was surprised not to find
Hall Caine there, but it appeared he clearly understood
I was to get out at a different station altogether. I was
also delayed in arriving, as I asked a countryman my
direction and he told me to go to the left&mdash;but from the
shape of the coast I argued that the right must be the
proper way&mdash;I went to the right in consequence, and
nearly succeeded in going over a cliff’s edge, while my
theory was decidedly vanquished by facts. However the
walk repaid it. Oh, the larks yesterday! It was as
warm as June, and Rossetti and Caine and myself went
out and lay in the grass (at least I did) basking in the
sun, looking down on the gleaming sea, and hearing
these heavenly incarnate little joys sending thrills of
sweetness, and vague pain through all my being. I
seemed all a-quiver with the delight of it all. And the
smell of the wrack! and the cries of the sea-birds! and
the delicious wash of the incoming tide! Oh, dear me, I
shall hate to go back to-morrow. Caine is writing a
sonnet in your book, Watts is writing a review for the
<i>Athenæum</i>, Rossetti is about to go on with painting his
Joan of Arc, and I am writing the last lines of this note
to you.”</p>

<p class="p1">Little did he dream as he shook hands with his host on
the Monday morning that he was bidding a last farewell
to his good friend.</p>

<p>Of that visit he wrote later:</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“Of my most cherished memories is a night at Birchington-on-Sea,
in March, 1882. It had been a lovely day.
Rossetti asked me to go out with him for a stroll on the
cliff; and though he leaned heavily and dragged his
limbs wearily as if in pain, he grew more cheerful as the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
sunlight warmed him. The sky was a cloudless blue and
the singing of at least a score of larks was wonderful to
listen to. Everywhere Spring odours prevailed, with an
added pungency from the sea-wrack below. Beyond, the
sea reached far to horizons of purple shaded azure. At
first I thought Rossetti was indifferent: but this mood
gave way. He let go my arm and stood staring seaward
silently, then, still in a low tired voice, but with a new
tone in it he murmured, ‘It is beautiful&mdash;the world
and life itself. I am glad I have lived.’ Insensibly
thereafter the dejection lifted from off his spirit, and for
the rest of that day and that evening he was noticeably
less despondent.</p>

<p class="pbq">“The previous evening Christina Rossetti and myself
were seated in the semi-twilight in the low-roofed sitting
room. She had been reading to him but he had grown
weary and somewhat fretful. Not wishing to disturb
him, Miss Rossetti made a sign to me to come over to the
window and there drew my attention to a quiet hued but
very beautiful sunset. While we were enjoying it Rossetti,
having overheard an exclamation of almost rapturous
delight from Christina, rose from his great armchair
before the fire and walked feebly to the window.
He stared blankly upon the dove-tones and pale amethyst
of the sky. I saw him glance curiously at his sister,
and then again long and earnestly. But at last with
a voice full of chagrin he turned away pettishly saying
he could not see what it was we admired so much. ‘It is
all gray and gloom,’ he added; nor would he hear a word
to the contrary, so ignorant was he of the havoc wrought
upon his optic nerve by the chloral poison which did so
much to shorten his life.... ‘Poor Gabriel,’ Miss Rossetti
said, ‘I wish he could have at least one hopeful
hour again.’ It was with pleasure therefore next day
she heard of what he had said upon the cliff, and how
he had brightened. The evening that followed was a
happy one, for, as already mentioned Rossetti grew so
cheerful, relatively, that it seemed as though the shadow
of death had lifted. What makes it doubly memorable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
to me is that when I opened the door for Miss Rossetti
when she bade me good-night, she turned, took my hand
again, and said in a whisper, ‘I am so glad about Gabriel,
and grateful.’”</p>

<p class="p1">To E. A. S.:</p>

<p class="pbqr p1">11: 4: 82.</p>

<p class="pbq">“...After spending a very pleasant day at Haileybury
with Farquharson [E. A. Sharp’s brother] we arrived
late in London, and while glancing over an evening
paper my eye suddenly caught a paragraph which made
my heart almost stop. I could not bring myself to read
it for a long time, though I knew it simply rechronicled
the heading&mdash;“Sudden Death of Mr. Dante Gabriel Rossetti.”
He died on Sunday night at Birchington. I cannot
tell you what a grief this is to me. He has ever
been to me a true friend, affectionate and generous&mdash;and
to him I owe more perhaps than to any one after
yourself. Apart from my deep regret at the loss of one
whom I so loved, I have also the natural regret at what
the loss of his living friendship means. I feel as if a
sudden tower of strength on which I had greatly relied
had given way: for not only would Rossetti’s house have
been my own as long as and whenever I needed, but it
was his influence while alive that I so much looked to.
Comparatively little known to the public, his name has
always been a power and recommendation in itself
amongst men of letters and artists and those who have
to do with both professions. When I recall all that Rossetti
has been to me&mdash;the pleasure he has given me&mdash;the
encouragement, the fellowship&mdash;I feel very bitter at
heart to think I shall never see again the kindly gray
eyes and the massive head of the great poet and artist.
He has gone to his rest. It were selfish to wish otherwise
considering all things....</p>

<p class="pbq">If I take flowers down, part of the wreath shall be
from you. He would have liked it himself, for he knew
you through me, and he knew I am happier in this than
most men perhaps.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span></p>


<p class="p1">To E. A. S.:</p>

<p class="pbqr p1">April 13, 1882.</p>

<p class="pbq">“ ... I have just returned (between twelve and one at
night) tired and worn out with some necessary things
in connection with Rossetti, taking me first to Chelsea,
then away in the opposite direction to Euston Road.
As I go down to Birchington by an early train, besides
having much correspondence to get through after
breakfast, I can only write a very short letter. I have
felt the loss of my dear and great friend more and more.
He had weaknesses and frailties within the last six or
eight months owing to his illness, but to myself he was
ever patient and true and affectionate. A grand heart
and soul, a true friend, a great artist, a great poet, I
shall not meet with such another. He loved me, I know&mdash;and
believed and hoped great things of me, and within
the last few days I have learned <i>how</i> generously and
how urgently he impressed this upon others. God knows
I do not grudge him his long-looked-for rest, yet I can
hardly imagine London without him. I <i>cannot</i> realise it,
and yet I know that I shall never again see the face
lighten up when I come near, never again hear the voice
whose mysterious fascination was like a spell. What
fools are those vain men who talk of death: blinded, and
full of the dust of corruption. As God lives, the soul
dies not. What though the grave be silent, and the darkness
of the Shadow become not peopled&mdash;to those eyes
that can see there is light, light, light&mdash;to those ears that
can hear the tumult of the disenfranchised, rejoicing.
I am borne down not with the sense of annihilation, but
with the vastness of life and the imminence of things
spiritual. I <i>know</i> from something beyond and out of myself
that we are now but dying to live, that there is
no death, which is but as a child’s dream in a weary
night.</p>

<p class="pbq">I am very tired. You will forgive more, my dearest
friend.”</p>

<p class="pbqr">W. S.</p>

<p class="p1">Keenly desirous of offering some tribute to the memory
of Rossetti, whose friendship had meant so much to him
during the years of struggle in London, William Sharp
eagerly accepted a proposal from Messrs. Macmillan that
he should write a biographical Record and appreciation
of the painter-poet, to be produced within the year. It
was begun in June, it was his first lengthy attempt in
prose and attempted with little knowledge of the art of
writing; but it was written “red hot,” as he used to say,
inspired by deep affection and profound admiration for
his friend. He spared no pains to make his story as
accurate as practicable, and visited the chief owners of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
the pictures, photographs of which Rossetti had given
him. Several of the later paintings he had seen and
discussed many times in Rossetti’s studio.</p>

<p>The book divides itself naturally into two parts representing
the man in his dual capacity as painter and as
poet, and the author selected as frontispiece Rossetti’s
most characteristic and symbolic design for his sonnet
on the sonnet.</p>

<p>In his Diary of 1890 the author refers to “my first
serious effort in prose, my honest and enthusiastic, and
indeed serviceable, but badly written ‘Life of Rossetti.’”
And he tells that the first two thirds were written at
Clynder on the Gareloch (Argyll), “in a little cottage
where I stayed with my mother and sisters eight years
ago”; and the rest was written in London, and published
in December.</p>

<p>“I remember that the book was finished one December
day, and so great was the pressure I was under,
that, at the end, I wrote practically without a break
for thirty-six hours: i. e., I began immediately after an
early breakfast, wrote all day except half an hour for
dinner, and all evening with less than ten minutes for
a slight meal of tea and toast, and right through the
night. About 4 or 5 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span> my fire went out, though I did
not feel chilled till my landlady came with my breakfast.
By this time I was too excited to be tired, and
had moreover to finish the book that day. I was only a
few minutes over breakfast, which I snatched during
perusal of some notes, and then buckled to again. I
wrote all day, eating nothing. When about 7 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span> I came
to ‘finis,’ I threw down the pen from my chilled and
cramped fingers: walked or rather staggered into the
adjoining bedroom, but was asleep before I could undress
beyond removal of my coat and waistcoat. (What
hundreds of times I have been saved weariness and bad
headaches, how often I have been preserved from collapse
of a more serious kind, by my rare faculty of
being able to sleep at will at any time, however busy,
and for even the briefest intervals&mdash;ten minutes or less.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span></p>

<p>“For three weeks before this I had been overworking
and I was quite exhausted, partly from want of sufficient
nourishment. It was the saving of my brain, therefore,
that I slept fourteen hours without a break, and after
a few hours of tired and dazed wakefulness again fell
into a prolonged slumber, from which I awoke fresh and
vigorous in mind and body.”</p>

<p>The most interesting letter which he received during
the interval of the writing was one from Robert Browning,
in answer to an inquiry concerning a letter written
years earlier by Rossetti to Browning, to know if the author
of <i>Paracelsus</i> was also the author of <i>Pauline</i>. Rossetti
once told William Sharp that it was “on the forenoon
of the day when the <i>Burden of Nineveh</i> was begun,
conceived rather,” that he read this story (at the British
Museum) “of a soul by the soul’s ablest historian.”
So delighted was Rossetti with it, and so strong his opinion
that <i>Pauline</i> was by Browning, that he wrote to that
poet, then in Florence, for confirmation. Mr. Browning,
in his reply&mdash;which I quote from my husband’s monograph
on Browning&mdash;gave the following particulars of
the incident:</p>

<p class="pr5 p1 reduct"><span class="smcap">St. Pierre de Chartreuse</span>,</p>
<p class="pr4 reduct">Aug. 22, 1882.</p>

<p class="pn"><span class="smcap">Dear Mr. Sharp</span>,</p>

<p class="pbq">Rossetti’s <i>Pauline</i> letter concerning which you inquire
was addressed to me at Florence, more than thirty years
ago: I must have preserved it, but, even were I at home,
should be unable to find it without troublesome searching.
It was to the effect that the writer, personally and
altogether unknown to me, had come upon a poem in the
British Museum, which he copied the whole of, from its
being not otherwise procurable, that he judged it to be
mine, but could not be sure, and wished me to pronounce
on the matter&mdash;which I did. A year or two after,
I had a visit in London from Mr. Allingham and a friend&mdash;who
proved to be Rossetti: when I heard he was a
painter I insisted on calling on him, though he declared
he had nothing to show me&mdash;which was far enough from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
the case. Subsequently on another of my returns to London,
he painted my portrait: not, I fancy, in oils but
water colours&mdash;and finished it in Paris shortly after:
this must have been in the year when Tennyson published
“Maud,” unless I mistake: for I remember Tennyson
reading the poem one evening, while Rossetti made
a rapid pen-and-ink sketch of him, very good, from an
unobserved corner of vantage&mdash;which I still possess and
duly value. This was before Rossetti’s marriage.</p>

<p class="pbq">I hope that these particulars may answer your purpose;
and beg you to believe me, dear Mr. Sharp,</p>

<p class="pr6 reduct">Yours very truly,</p>
<p class="pr4 reduct"><span class="smcap">Robert Browning</span>.</p>


<p class="p1">The young biographer wrote to every one who he
thought might possess drawings or paintings by Rossetti&mdash;and
among others he applied to Tennyson. The Poet
Laureate replied:</p>

<p class="pr5 p1 reduct"><span class="smcap">Aldworth, Haslemere</span>,</p>
<p class="pr4 reduct">Oct. 12, 1882.</p>

<p class="pn"><span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,</p>

<div class="pbq">
<p>I have neither drawing nor painting by Rossetti. I
am sorry for it, for some of his work which I have seen
elsewhere I have admired very much; nor (as far as I
know) have I any letter from him, nor have I the slightest
recollection of his being present when I was “reading
the proof sheets of Maud.”</p>

<p>My acquaintance with him was in fact but an acquaintance,
not an “intimacy,” though I would willingly have
known something more of so accomplished an artist.</p>

<p>Wishing all success to your Memorial of him,</p></div>

<p class="pr8 reduct">I am,</p>
<p class="pr5 reduct">Faithfully yours,</p>
<p class="pr4 reduct"><span class="smcap">A. Tennyson</span>.</p>


<p class="p1">The book met with immediate success; it was recognised
that the work was “one of no ordinary difficulty,”
that the author “brought fairness and critical acumen
to his task,” “truest enthusiasm and perseverance that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
nothing can daunt; that by reason of his friendship he
had unusual insight into the history and work of Rossetti,”
and “a critic of Art and a writer of poems he is
thus further to be respected in what he has to say.”
Only three letters are in my possession of the many he
received from friends of his own, or of the dead poet;
two are from Walter Pater with whom he had recently
become acquainted: and the other from Christina Rossetti:</p>

<p class="pbqr p1"><span class="smcap">30 Torrington Square.</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Mr. Sharp</span>,</p>

<p class="pbq">Thank you with warm thanks from my Mother and myself
for your precious gift. She has already and with
true pleasure perused Chapter I. <i>I</i> have but glanced
here and there as yet but with an appetite for the feast to
come. I shall be both fortunate and unfortunate if I
find occasion for the marginal notes you want&mdash;fortunate
if even thus I can be of use: but I will rather wish
myself a very narrow field for strictures. Allow me to
congratulate you on the binding of the well-known monogram
and crest&mdash;a pretty point which catches and gratifies
the eye at a first glance. I figure so amiably in connection
with your frontispiece that I may reasonably
regret having brought nothing to the transaction (in reality)
beyond good will.</p>

<p class="p1">This letter was received while the book was in preparation:</p>

<p class="pn"><span class="smcap">My dear Sharp</span>,</p>

<p class="pbq">(I think we have known each other long enough to drop
the “Mr.”) I read your letter with great pleasure, and
thank you very much for it. Your friendly interest in
my various essays I value highly. I have really worked
hard for now many years at these prose essays, and it is a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
real encouragement to hear such good things said of them
by one of the most original of young English poets. It
will be a singular pleasure to me to be connected, in a
sense, in your book on Rossetti, with one I admired so
greatly. I wish the book all the success both the subject
and the writer deserve. You encourage me to do what
I have sometimes thought of doing, when I have got
on a little further with the work I have actually on hand&mdash;viz.
to complete the various series of which the papers
I have printed in the <i>Fortnightly</i> are parts. The list you
sent me is complete with the exception of an article on
Coleridge in the <i>Westminster</i> of January, 1866, with
much of which, both as to matter and manner, I should
now be greatly dissatisfied. That article is concerned
with S. T. C.’s prose; but, corrected, might be put alongside
of the criticism on his verse which I made for
Ward’s “English Poets.” I can only say that should you
finish the paper you speak of on these essays, your critical
approval will be of great service to me with the reading
public. I find I have by me a second copy of the
paper on Giorgione, revised in print, which I send by
this post, and hope you will kindly accept. It was reprinted
some time ago when I thought of collecting that
and other papers into a volume. I am pleased to hear
that you remember with pleasure your flying visit to
Oxford; and hope you will come for a longer stay in term
time early next year. At the end of this month I hope
to leave for seven weeks in Italy, chiefly at Rome, where
I have never yet been. We went to Cornwall for our
summer holiday, but though that country is certainly
very singular and beautiful, I found there not a tithe of
the stimulus to one’s imagination which I have sometimes
experienced in quite unrenowned places abroad.</p>

<p class="pbq">I should be delighted with a copy of the Rossetti volume
from yourself; but it is a volume I should have in
any case purchased, and I hope it may appear in time to
be my companion on my contemplated journey.</p>

<p class="pbq">Thank you very sincerely for the copy of your book,
with the fine impression of the beautiful frontispiece,
which reached me yesterday. One copy of the book I
had already obtained through a bookseller in Rome, and
read it there with much admiration of its wealth of ideas

Thank you also sincerely, for the pleasant
things you have said about myself; all the pleasanter
for being said in connection with the subject of Rossetti,
whose genius and work I esteemed so greatly. I am
glad to hear that the book is having the large sale it deserves.
Your letter of December 24th, was forwarded to
me at Rome, with the kind invitation I should have been
delighted to accept had it been possible, and which I hope
you will let me profit by some other time. Then, I heard
from my sisters, of your search for me in London, and
was very sorry to have missed you there. I shall be
delighted to see you here; and can give you a bed at

<p class="p1">It had been William Sharp’s intention to rewrite his
Study on Rossetti; for in later years he was very dissatisfied
with the early book, and considered his judgment
to have been immature. He had indeed arranged
certain publishing preliminaries; and he wrote the dedicatory
chapter; but the book itself was untouched save
one or two opening sentences. For this project, with
many others planned by William Sharp, was laid aside
when the more intimate, the more imperative work put
forward under the pseudonym of “Fiona Macleod” began<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
to shape itself in his brain. In his dedication to
Walter Pater (the only portion of the book that was
finished), the author explains his reasons for wishing to
write a second Study of the painter-poet. He describes
the new material available, and relates that in Rossetti’s
lifetime it was planned that a “Life should be
written by Philip Bourke Marston and myself, primarily
for publication in America. Rossetti took a humorous
interest in the scheme, and often alluded to it in notes
or conversation as the Bobbies’ book (a whimsical substitute
for the Boston firm of Roberts Brothers, whom we
intended to honour with our great&mdash;unwritten&mdash;work):
but nothing came of the project.... Rossetti was
eager to help Marston; so he said he was charmed with
the idea, and promised to give all the aid in his power.
A week later he told me that ‘there was no good in it,’
and that ‘it had better drop’: but, instead he suggested
that <i>he</i> should write an article upon Marston and his
poetry for <i>Harper’s</i>, or <i>Scribner’s</i>, if it were more expedient
that such an article should appear in an American
periodical, or, if preferred, for some important
Quarterly here.</p>

<p>“But you, cognizant as you are of much of this detail,
will readily understand and agree with me when I say
that no really adequate portrait of Rossetti is likely to
be given to us for many years to come. Possibly never:
for his was a nature wrought of so many complexities,
his a life developed perplexedly by such divers elements,
that he will reappear, for those who come after
us, not in any one portraiture but as an evocation from
many....</p>

<p>“Of all that has been written of Rossetti’s genius and
achievement in poetry nothing shows more essential insight,
is of more striking and enduring worth, than the
essay by yourself, included in your stimulating and always
delightful <i>Appreciations</i>. You, more than any one,
it seems to me, have understood and expressed the secret
of his charm. And though you have not written also of
Rossetti the painter, I know of no one who so well and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
from the first perceived just wherein lies his innate
power, his essential significance.</p>

<p>“Years ago, in Oxford, how often we talked these matters
over! I have often recalled one evening, in particular,
often recollected certain words of yours: and never
more keenly than when I have associated them with the
early work of Rossetti, in both arts, but preëminently in
painting: ‘To my mind Rossetti is the most significant
man among us. More torches will be lit from his flame&mdash;or
torches lit at his flame&mdash;than perhaps even enthusiasts
like yourself imagine.’</p>

<p>“We are all seeking a lost Eden. This ideal Beauty
that we catch glimpses of, now in morning loveliness, now
in glooms of tragic terror, haunts us by day and night,
in dreams of waking and sleeping&mdash;nay, whether or not
we will, among the littlenesses and exigencies of our
diurnal affairs. It may be that, driven from the Eden
of direct experience, we are being more and more forced
into taking refuge within the haven guarded by our
dreams. To a few only is it given to translate, with rare
distinction and excellence, something of this manifold
message of Beauty&mdash;though all of us would fain be, with
your Marius, ‘of the number of those who must be made
perfect by the love of visible beauty.’ Among these few,
in latter years in this country, no one has wrought more
exquisitely for us than Rossetti.</p>

<p>“To him, and to you and all who recreate for us the
things we have vaguely known and loved, or surmised
only, or previsioned in dreams, we owe what we can
never repay save by a rejoicing gratitude. Our own
Eden may be irrecoverable, its haunting music never be
nearer or clearer than a vanishing echo, yet we have the
fortunate warranty of those whose guided feet have led
them further into the sunlit wilderness, who have repeated
to us, as with hieratic speech, what they have
seen and heard.</p>

<p>“‘From time to time,’ wrote Rossetti in one of those
early prose passages of his which are so consecrated by
the poetic atmosphere&mdash;‘from time to time, however, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
poet or a painter has caught the music (of that garden),
and strayed in through the close stems: the spell is on
his hand and his lips like the sleep of the Lotus-eaters,
and his record shall be vague and fitful; yet will we be in
waiting, and open our eyes and our ears, for the broken
song has snatches of an enchanted harmony, and the
glimpses are glimpses of Eden.’”</p>

<p>It was during the preparation of this early book that
the first volume of William Sharp’s poems was published&mdash;too
late however to be welcomed by either of the two
friends who had taken so keen an interest in its growth:
Rossetti, to whom all the poems had been read&mdash;and
John Elder to whom it was originally dedicated. It is
entitled <i>The Human Inheritance; Motherhood; Transcripts
from Nature</i> (Elliot Stock), and contains a prefatory
poem, and last lines dedicated to myself.</p>

<p>“The Human Inheritance” is a long poem in four
cycles&mdash;the Inheritance of Childhood, Youth, Manhood
and Womanhood, and Old Age, and was an expression of
his belief that the human being should fearlessly reach
out to every experience that each period might have to
offer. Eager, and intensely alive, the poet thirsted till
his last breath after whatever might broaden and deepen
his knowledge, his understanding, his enjoyment of life.</p>

<p>The second long poem, “The New Hope: a Vision of
the Travail of Humanity,” was especially connected with
John Elder, the outcome of many talks and letters concerning
the purport of the Travail of Humanity&mdash;concerning
a belief they both held that a great new spiritual
awakening is imminent that</p>

<p class="ppn14 p1">... “the one great Word</p>
<p class="ppn6">That spake, shall wonderfully again be heard” ...</p>

<p class="p1">To “Motherhood” allusion has been made in one or
two letters.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding that some of the critics predicted
that the new name was destined to become conspicuous,
it was not by these poems, but by the Life of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
Rossetti that the real impetus was given to his literary
fortunes and emphasised the fact of his existence to publishers
and the reading public. But to the poet himself&mdash;and
to me&mdash;the publication of the book of poems was a
great event. We looked upon it as the beginning of the
true work of his life, toward the fulfilment of which we
were both prepared to make any sacrifice.</p>

<p>I have a few letters relating to this volume of poems,
and append the three which the recipient especially cared
to preserve:</p>

<p class="pr5 p1 reduct">2 <span class="smcap">Bradmore Road</span>,</p>
<p class="pr4 reduct">July 30th.</p>

<p class="pn"><span class="smcap">My dear Sharp</span>,</p>

<p class="pbq">Since you have been here I have been reading your
poems with great enjoyment. The presence of philosophical,
as in “The New Hope” and of such original,
and at the same time perfectly natural motives as
“Motherhood” is certainly a remarkable thing among
younger English poets, especially when united with a
command of rhythmical and verbal form like yours. The
poem “Motherhood” is of course a bold one; but it expresses,
as I think, with perfect purity, a thought, which
all who can do so are the better for meditating on. The
“Transcripts from Nature” seem to me precisely all,
and no more than (and just how is the test of excellence
in such things) what little pictures in verse ought to be.</p>

<p class="pr6 reduct">Very sincerely yours,</p>
<p class="pr6 reduct"><span class="smcap">Walter Pater</span>.</p>


<p class="pn1"><span class="smcap">Dear Mr. Sharp</span>,</p>

<div class="pbq">
<p>I have really not much to say about your poems. That
you are of the tribe or order of prophets, I certainly believe.
What rank you may take in that order I cannot
guess. But the essential thing is that you are the thing
<i>poet</i>, and being such I doubt much whether talk about
your gift and what you ought to do with it will help you
at all.</p>

<p>In “Motherhood” I think you touch the highest point
in the volume. The “Transcripts from Nature”&mdash;some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
of them&mdash;give me the <i>feel</i> in my nerves of the place and
hour you describe, I like the form but I think you have
written a sufficient mass in this form, and that future
<i>rispetti</i> ought to be rare, that is, whenever it is necessary
and right to express yourself in that form. (It is harder
to take in many in succession than even sonnets.) The
longer poems seem to me as decisively the poetry of a
poet as the others, but they seem not so successful (while
admirable in many pages and in various ways).</p>

<p>I believe a beautiful action, beautifully if somewhat
severely handled, would bring out your highest. I wish
you had some heroic old Scotch story to brood over and
make live while you are in Scotland.</p>

<p>I look forward with much interest to your Pre-Raphaelism
and Rossetti.</p></div>

<p class="pbqr p1">Sept. 6, 1882.</p>

<p class="pn"><span class="smcap">Dear Mr. Sharp</span>,</p>

<p class="pbq">... I came abroad and brought your book with me. I
have read it again through among the mountains and
have found much to admire and more than like in it; so
that the hours I passed in reading it are and will be pleasant
hours to remember. If I may venture a criticism it is
that nature occupies more than three fourths of the Emotion
of the Book, and not Humanity, and even the passion
and childhood and youth, and later love and age&mdash;and
all passions are painted in terms of Nature, and
through her moods. It pleases me, for I care more for
Nature myself when I am not pressed on by human feeling,
than I do for Man, but an artist ought to love Man
more than Nature, and should write about Him for his
own sake. It won’t do to become like the being in the
“Palace of Art.” It will not do either to live in a Palace
of Nature, alone. But all this is more a suggestion than
an objection, and it is partly suggested to me at first by
the fact that the poem in the midst of The Human Inheritance,
Cycle III, is the nearest to the human heart<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
and yet the least well written of all the cycles&mdash;at least
so it seems to me. I like exceedingly “The Tides of
Venice.” It seems to me to come nearer the kind of poem
in which the Poet’s Shuttle weaves into one web Nature
and Humanity and the close is very solemn and noble.</p>

<p class="pbq">You asked me to do a critic’s part. It is a part I hate,
and I am not a critic. But I say what I say for the sake
of men and women whom you may help through the giving
of high pleasure even more than you help them in
this book.</p>

<p class="pr8 reduct">With much sympathy and admiration,</p>
<p class="pr6 reduct">I am yours most sincerely,</p>
<p class="pr4 reduct"><span class="smcap">Stopford A. Brooke</span>.</p>

<p class="p1">Two other deaths occurred in this year, and made a
profound impression on the young writer. I quote his
own words:</p>

<p>“It was in 1882 also that another friend, to whom
Philip Marston had also become much attached&mdash;attracted
in the first instance by the common bond of
unhappiness&mdash;died under peculiarly distressing circumstances.
Philip Marston and myself were, if I am not
mistaken, the last of his acquaintances to see him alive.
Thomson had suffered such misery and endured such
hopelessness, that he had yielded to intemperate habits,
including a frequent excess in the use of opium. He had
come back from a prolonged visit to the country, where
all had been well with him, but through over confidence
he had fallen a victim again immediately on his return.
For a few weeks his record is almost a blank. When
the direst straits were reached, he so far reconquered
his control that he felt able to visit one whose sympathy
and regard had stood all tests. Marston soon realised
that his friend was mentally distraught, and endured
a harrowing experience, into the narrative of
which I do not care to enter.</p>

<p>“I arrived in the late afternoon, and found Philip in
a state of nervous perturbation. Thomson was lying
down on the bed in the adjoining room: stooping I caught<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
his whispered words that he was dying; upon which I lit
a match, and in the sudden glare beheld his white face on
the blood-stained pillow.</p>

<p>“He had burst one or more blood-vessels, and the hæmorrhage
was dreadful. Some time had to elapse before
anything could be done; ultimately with the help of a
friend who came in opportunely, poor Thomson was carried
downstairs, and having been placed in a cab, was
driven to the adjoining University Hospital. He did not
die that night, nor when Marston and I went to see him
in the ward next day was he perceptibly worse, but a few
hours after our visit he passed away.</p>

<p>“Thus ended the saddest life with which I have
ever come in contact&mdash;sadder even than that of Philip
Marston, though his existence was oftentimes bitter
enough to endure....”</p>

<p>The other death was that of Emerson, whose writings
had been a potent influence in the life-thought of the
young Scot from his college days. Indeed throughout
his life Emerson’s Essays were a constant stimulus and
refreshment. “My Bible,” as he called the Volume of
Selected Essays, accompanied him in all his wanderings,
and during the last weeks he spent in Sicily in 1905 he
carefully studied it anew and annotated it copiously.</p>

<p>On hearing of Emerson’s death he wrote a poem in
memoriam&mdash;“Sleepy Hollow”&mdash;which was printed in the
<i>Academy</i> and afterward in his second volume of verse
<i>Earth’s Voices</i>. According to <i>Harper’s Weekly</i> (3: 6:
1882) “No finer tribute has been rendered to Emerson’s
memory than William Sharp’s beautiful poem ‘Sleepy
Hollow.’ And, as <i>Earth’s Voices</i> is now out of print, I
will quote it in full:</p>


<p class="pc1">SLEEPY HOLLOW<br />
<i>In Memoriam: Ralph Waldo Emerson</i></p>

<p class="pph6 p1">He sleeps here the untroubled sleep<br />
Who could not bear the noise and moil<br />
Of public life, but far from toil</p>
<p class="pph6">A happy reticence did keep.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span></p>

<p class="pph6 p1">With Nature only open, free:<br />
Close by there rests the magic mind<br />
Of him who took life’s thread to wind</p>
<p class="pph6">And weave some poor soul’s mystery</p>

<p class="pph6 p1">Of spirit-life, and made it live<br />
A type and wonder for all days;<br />
No sweeter soul e’er trod earth’s ways</p>
<p class="pph6">Than he who here at last did give</p>

<p class="pph6 p1">His body back to earth again.<br />
And now at length beside them lies<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a><br />
One great and true and nobly wise&mdash;</p>
<p class="pph6">A King of Thought, whose spotless reign</p>

<p class="pph6 p1">The overwhelming years that come<br />
And drown the trash and dross and slime<br />
Shall keep a record of till Time</p>
<p class="pph6">Shall cease, and voice of man be dumb.</p>

<p class="pph6 p1">At lasts he rests, whose high clear hope<br />
Was wont on lofty wings to scan<br />
The future destinies of man&mdash;</p>
<p class="pph6">Who saw the Race through darkness grope,</p>

<p class="pph6 p1">Through mists and error, till at last<br />
The looked-for light, the longed-for age<br />
Should dawn for peasant, prince, and sage,</p>
<p class="pph6">And centuries of night be past.</p>

<p class="pph6 p1">Thy rest is won: O loyal, brave,<br />
Wise soul, thy spirit is not dead&mdash;<br />
Thy wing’d words far and wide have fled,</p>
<p class="pph6">Undying, they shall find no grave.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER V</h2>

<p class="pch">FIRST VISIT TO ITALY</p>

<p>“After Rossetti’s death, I wrote,” William Sharp has
related, “to the commission of Messrs. Macmillan, a record
of his achievements in the two arts of literature and
poetry, my first and of course immature attempt at a
book of prose. I had also written a book of poems,
which, however, did not attract much attention, though
it had the honour of a long and flattering review
in the <i>Athenæum</i>. Happily, it seems to have fallen
into the hands of the editor of <i>Harper’s Magazine</i>,
for some time afterward I received a letter from him
asking me to let him see any poems I had by me. I sent
him all I had and the matter passed from my mind.
Months went by, and I remember how, one day, I had
almost reached my last penny. In fact, my only possession
of any value was a revolver, the gift of a friend.
That night I made up my mind to enlist next morning.
When I got up on the following morning there were two
letters for me. The usual thing, I said to myself, notice
of ‘declined with thanks.’ I shoved them into my
pocket. A little later in the day, however, recollection
impelled me to open one of the letters. It was from the
editor of <i>Harper’s</i>, enclosing a cheque for forty pounds
for my few <i>Transcripts from Nature</i>, little six-line poems,
to be illustrated by Mr. Alfred Parsons, A.R.A. That
money kept me going for a little time. Still it was a
struggle, and I had nearly reached the end of my resources
when one day I came across the other letter I
had received that morning. I opened and found it to be
from a, to me, unknown friend of one who had known my
grandfather. He had heard from Sir Noel Paton that I
was inclined to the study of literature and art. He therefore
enclosed a cheque for two hundred pounds, which I
was to spend in going to Italy to pursue my artistic
studies. I was, of course, delighted with the windfall, so
delighted, indeed, that I went the length of framing the
cheque and setting it up in my lodgings. I tried to get
my landlord to advance me the not very ambitious loan
of a needed sovereign on the spot, but he only shook his
head knowingly, as if he suspected something. However,
at last, he risked a pound, and I think I spent most of it
that afternoon in taking the landlady and her family to
the pantomime.</p>

<p>“Eventually I went to Italy and spent five months
away.”</p>

<p>Thus, the year 1883 opened with brighter prospects.
Not only was it easier to get articles accepted and
published, but “William obtained the post of London Art
Critic to <i>The Glasgow Herald</i>, to be taken up in the
autumn. During his stay in London he had made a continual
study of the Old Masters, and his connection with
The Fine Art Society had brought him in touch with
modern work and living artists. Therefore, with the
opportune cheque in his pocket he decided to spend the
ensuing months in careful study of pictures in Italy.</p>

<p>He left London at the end of February, and remained
in Italy till the end of June, when he joined my mother
and myself in the Ardennes.</p>

<p>He went first of all to stay with an aunt of mine, Mrs.
Smillie, who had a villa in the outskirts of Florence.
From that city and later from Rome and Venice he
wrote to me the following impressions:</p>


<p class="pr6 p1 reduct"><span class="smcap">Florence</span>,</p>
<p class="pr4 reduct">Wednesday, 14: 3: 83.</p>

<p class="pbq">... “Yesterday morning I went to Sta. Maria Novella,
and enjoyed it greatly. It is a splendid place, though on
a first visit I was less impressed than by Santa Croce....</p>

<p class="pbq">The monumental sculpture is not so fine as in Santa
Croce, but on the other hand there are some splendid
paintings and frescoes&mdash;amongst others Cimabue’s famous
picture of the Virgin seated on a throne. I admired
some frescoes by Fillipino Lippi&mdash;also those in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
Choir by Ghirlandajio: in the Capella dei Strozzi (to
the left) I saw the famous frescoes of Orcagna, the Inferno
and Paradiso. They greatly resemble the same
subjects by the same painter in the Campo Santo at Pisa.
What a horrible imagination, poisoned by horrible superstitions,
these old fellows had: his Paradise, while in
some ways finely imagined, is stiff and unimpressive, and
his Inferno simply repellent. It is strange that religious
art should have in general been so unimaginative. The
landscapes I care most for here are those of the early
Giottesque and pre-Raphaelite painters&mdash;they are often
very beautiful&mdash;for the others, there is more in Turner
than in them all put together....”</p>

<p class="pr4 p1 reduct"><span class="smcap">Florence</span>, 18: 3: 83.</p>

<p class="pbq">“ ... Well, yesterday after lunch I went to the Chiesa
del Carmine, and was delighted greatly with the famous
frescoes of Masaccio, which I studied for an hour or
more with great interest. He was a wonderful fellow to
have been the first to have painted movement, for his
figures have much grace of outline and freedom of pose.
Altogether I have been more struck by Masaccio than
by any other artist save Michel Angelo and Leonardo
da Vinci. If he hadn’t died so young (twenty-seven) I believe
he would have been amongst the very first in actual
accomplishment. He <i>did</i> something, which is more than
can be said for many others more famous than himself,
who merely duplicated unimaginative and stereotyped
religious ideals....</p>

<p class="pbq">Yesterday being Holy Thursday we went to several
Churches and in the afternoon and evening to see the
Flowers for the Sepulchres. Very much impressed and
excited by all I saw. I was quite unprepared for the
mystery and gloom of the Duomo. There were (comparatively)
few people there, as it is not so popular
with the Florentines as Sta. Maria Novella&mdash;and when
we entered, it was like going into a tomb. Absolute darkness
away by the western entrances (closed), a dark
gloom elsewhere, with gray trails of incense mist still<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
floating about like wan spirits, and all the crosses and
monuments draped in black crape, and a great canopy
of the same overhead. Two acolytes held burning
tapers before only one monument, that of the Pietà under
the great crucifix in the centre of the upper aisle&mdash;so
that the light fell with startling distinctness on the
dead and mutilated body of Christ. Not a sound was to
be heard but the wild chanting of the priests, and at last
a single voice with a strain of agony in every tone. This
and the mystery and gloom and pain (for, strange as it
may seem to you, I felt the agony of the pierced hands
and feet myself) quite overcame me, and I burst into
tears. I think I would have fainted with the strain and
excitement, if the Agony of the Garden had not come to
an end, and the startling crash of the scourging commenced,
the slashing of canes upon the stones and pillars.
I was never so impressed before. I left, and wandered
away by myself along the deserted Lung-Arno,
still shivering with the excitement of almost foretasted
death I had experienced, and unable to control the tears
that came whenever I thought of Christ’s dreadful
agony. To-day (Good Friday) the others have gone to
church, but I couldn’t have gone to listen to platitudes&mdash;and
don’t know if I can bring myself to enter the catholic
churches again till the Crucifixion is over, as I dread a
repetition of last night’s suffering. I shall probably go
to hear the Passion Music in the church of the Badia (the
finest in Florence for music). How I wish you were with
me....”</p>

<div class="pbq">
<p>“ ... The last two days have been days of great enjoyment
to me. First and foremost they have been heavenly
warm, with cloudless ardent blue skies&mdash;and everything
is beginning to look fresh and green. Well, on Monday
I drove with Mrs. Smillie away out of the Porta San
Frediano till we came in sight of Scanducci Alto, and
then of the Villa Farinola. There I left her, and went
up through beautiful and English-like grounds to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
house, and was soon ushered in to Ouida’s presence. I
found her alone, with two of her famous and certainly
most beautiful dogs beside her. I found her most pleasant
and agreeable, though in appearance somewhat eccentric
owing to the way in which her hair was done, and
also partly to her dress which seemed to consist mainly
of lace. A large and beautiful room led into others, all
full of bric-a-brac, and filled with flowers, books, statuettes
and pictures (poor), by herself. We had a long
talk and she showed me many things of interest. Then
other people began to arrive (it was her reception day).</p>

<p>Before I left, Ouida most kindly promised to give me
some introductions to use in Rome. Yesterday she
drove in and left three introductions for me which may
be of good service&mdash;one to Lady Paget, wife of the British
Ambassador, one to the Storys, and one to Tilton, the
sculptor....</p>

<p>Yesterday I perhaps enjoyed more than I have done
since I came to Italy. In the morning Arthur Lemon, the
artist, called for me, and being joined by two others
(Lomax, an artist, and his brother) we had a boat carried
over the weir and we got into it at the Cascine and rowed
down stream past the junction of the Mugnone and Arno,
till Florence and Fiesole were shut from view, and the
hills all round took on extra beauty&mdash;Monte Beni on the
right and Monte Morello on the left glowing with a haze
of heat, and beyond all, the steeps of Vallombrosa in
white&mdash;and Carrara’s crags also snow-covered behind us.
We passed the quaint old church and village of San Stefano
and swung in-shore to get some wine....</p>

<p>We rowed on and in due course came in sight of Signa.
We put on a spurt (the four of us were rowing) and as
we swept at a swift rate below the old bridge it seemed as
if half the population came out to see the unusual sight
of <i>gentili signorini</i> exerting themselves so madly when
they might be doing nothing. We got out and said farewell
to the picturesque-looking fellow who had steered us
down&mdash;had some breakfast at a Trattoria, where we had
small fish half-raw and steeped in oil (but not at all bad)&mdash;kid’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
flesh, and delicious sheep’s-milk cheese, bread,
and light, red, Chianti wine. We then spent some two or
three hours roaming about Signa, which is a beautifully
situated dreamy sleepy old place&mdash;with beautiful “bits”
for artists every here and there&mdash;old walls with lizards
basking on them in numbers&mdash;and lovely views.</p>

<p>We came back by Lastia, a fine ancient walled town, and
arrived in Florence by open tramcar in the evening,
finally I had a delicious cold bath. The whole day was
heavenly. If the river has not sunk too low when I return
from Rome, Arthur Lemon and some other artists
and myself are going on a sketching trip down the Arno
amongst the old villages&mdash;the length of Pisa&mdash;taking
about two days.”</p></div>


<p class="pr4 p1 reduct"><span class="smcap">Rome.</span></p>

<div class="pbq">
<p>“ ... It is too soon to give you my impressions of Rome,
but I may say that they partly savour of disappointment....
Of one thing however, I have already seen enough
to convince me&mdash;and that is that Rome is not for a moment
to be compared to Florence in beauty&mdash;neither in
its environs, its situation, its streets, nor its rivers. Its
palaces may be grander, the interiors of its churches more
magnificent, its treasures of art more wonderful, but in
beauty it is as far short as London is of Edinburgh.
But it has one great loveliness which can never tire and
which charms immeasurably&mdash;the fountains which continually
and every here and there splash all day and
night in the sunlight or in green grottoes in the courts
of villas and palaces. I am certain that I should <i>hate</i> to
live here&mdash;I believe it would kill me&mdash;for Rome is too
old to be alive&mdash;unless indeed a new Rome entirely overshadows
the past. I don’t suppose you will quite understand,
and I cannot explain just now&mdash;but so I feel. Florence
(after the cold has gone) is divine&mdash;air, atmosphere,
situation, memory of the past, a still virile present&mdash;but
Rome is an anomaly, for what is predominant here
is that evil mediæval Rome whose eyes were blind with
blood and lust and hate. Ancient Rome is magnificent&mdash;but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
so little remains of it that one can no more live in it
than in Karnak or Thebes: as for modern Rome, everything
seems out of keeping&mdash;so that one has either to
weary with the dull Metropolitanism of the capital of
Italy or else to enter into the life of the mediæval
ages....</p>

<p>I expect and believe that I shall find Rome beautiful in
many things, even as she is already majestic and wonderful&mdash;and
that the more one becomes acquainted with the
Eternal City the more one loves or at least reverences
and delights in it.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, however, with me, it is more a sense of
oppression that I experience&mdash;a feeling as if life would
become intolerable unless all sense of the past were put
away. I hate death, and all that puts one in mind of
death&mdash;and after all Rome is only a gigantic and richly
ornamented tomb....</p>

<p>How I hate large cities! Even Florence is almost too
large, but there at least one can always escape into open
space and air and light and freedom at will&mdash;and the
mountains are close, and the country round on all sides
is fair, and the river is beautiful. Do not be provoked
with me when I say that Signa, for instance, is more
beautiful to me than Rome&mdash;and that the flashing of
sunlight in the waters of the fountains, the green of
Spring in the flowered fields and amongst the trees, and
the songs of birds and the little happy-eyed children,
mean infinitely more to me than the grandest sculptures,
the noblest frescoes, the finest paintings. This is my
drawback I am afraid, and not my praise&mdash;for where
such hundreds are intensely interested I am often but
slightly so. Again and again when I find myself wearied
to death with sight-seeing I call to mind some loch with
the glory of morning on it, some mountain-side flecked
with trailing clouds and thrilling me with the bleating of
distant sheep, the cries of the cliff hawks, and the wavering
echoes of waterfalls: or, if the mood, I recall some
happy and indolent forenoon in the Cascine or Monte
Oliveto or in the country paths leading from Bellosguardo,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
where I watched the shadows playing amongst
the olives and the dear little green and grey lizards
running endlessly hither and thither&mdash;and thinking of
these or such as these I grow comforted. And often
when walking in the Cascine by myself at sunset I have
heard a thrush or blackbird call to its mate through the
gloom of the trees, or when looking toward Morello and the
Appenine chain and seeing them aglow with wonderful
softness, or, on the Arno’s banks I have seen the river
washing in silver ripples and rosy light to the distant
crags of Carrara where the sun sank above the Pisan sea&mdash;often
at such times my thrill of passionate and sometimes
painful delight is followed by the irrepressible
conviction that such things are to me more beautiful,
more worthy of worship, more full of meaning, more
significant of life, more excelling in all manner of loveliness,
than all the treasures of the Uffizi and the Pitti,
the Vatican and the Louvre put together. But whenever
I have expressed such a conviction I have been told that
the works of man are after all nobler, in the truer sense
lovelier, and more spiritually refreshing and helpful&mdash;and
though I do not find them so, I must believe that to
most people such is the case, perhaps to the infinite
majority.</p>

<p>And, after all, why am I to be considered inferior to
my fellows because I love passionately in her every manifestation
the mother who has borne us all, and to whom
much that is noblest in art is due!...</p>

<p>Yet I would not be otherwise after all. I know some
things which few know, some secrets of beauty in cloud,
and sea and earth&mdash;have an inner communion with all
that meets my eyes in what we call nature, and am rich
with a wealth which I would not part with for all the
palaces in Rome. Do you understand me, Lill, in this?...
Poor dear! I had meant to have told her all
about my visit to Orvieto (alone worth coming to Italy
for&mdash;if only to behold the magnificent Cathedral) but
instead I have only relieved my mind in a kind of grumbling....</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span></p>

<p>What fascinates me most in Rome is the sculpture.
Well as I knew all the famous statues, from copies and
casts, some of them were almost like new revelations&mdash;especially
the Faun of Praxiteles, of which I had never
seen a really good copy. Can’t say, however, I felt enthusiastic
about the Capitoline Venus.”</p></div>


<p class="pbqr p1"><span class="smcap">Rome</span>, 16th April, 1883.</p>

<p class="pbq">“ ... I have just come in from the Campagna where
I have spent some of the happiest hours I have yet had
in Rome. I went for some three miles across the glorious
open reaches of tall grass, literally dense with myriads
of flowers&mdash;not a vestige of a house to be seen, not
a hint of Rome, nothing but miles upon miles of rolling
grassy slopes till they broke like a green sea against the
blue-purple hills, which were inexpressibly beautiful with
their cloud-shadows athwart their sides and the lingering
snows upon their heights. There was not a sound to be
heard save those dear sounds of solitary places, the endless
hum of insects, the cries of birds, the songs of many
larks, the scream of an occasional hawk, the splash of a
stream that will soon be dried up, and the exquisite,
delicious, heavenly music of the wind upon the grass and
in the infrequent trees.... And a good fairy watched
over me to-day, for I was peculiarly fortunate in seeing
one or two picturesque things I might have missed.
First, as I was listening to what a dear spark of a lintie
was whistling to its mate, I heard a dull heavy trampling
sound, and on going to a neighbouring rise I saw two
wild bulls fighting. I never realised before the immense
weight and strength these animals have. Soon after, a
herd of them came over the slope, their huge horns tossing
in the sunlight and often goring at each other. I
was just beginning to fancy that I had seen my last of
Rome (for I had been warned against these wild cattle
especially at this season) when some picturesquely-attired
horsemen on shaggy little steeds came up at full
speed, and with dogs and long spears or poles and frantic
cries urged the already half furious, half terrified<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
animals forward. It was delightful to witness, and if I
were a painter I would be glad to paint such a scene.
I then went across a brook and up some slopes (half
buried in flowers and grasses) till I came to a few blackthorn
trees and an old stone-pine, and from there I had
a divine view. The heat was very great, but I lay in a
pleasant dreamy state with my umbrella stuck tentwise,
and I there began the first chapter of the novel I told
you before I left that I intended writing. I had been
thinking over it often, and so at last began it: and certainly
few romances have been begun in lovelier places.
Suddenly, through one eye, as it were, I caught sight of
a broad moving shadow on the slope beyond me, and
looking up I was electrified with delight to see a large
eagle shining gold-bronze in the sun. I had no idea
(though I knew they preyed on the lambs, etc., further
on the Campagna and in the Maremma) that they ever
came so near the haunts of men. It gave one loud harsh
scream, a swoop of its broad wings, and then sailed
away out of sight into the blue haze beyond the farthest
reaches I could see. Away to the right I saw a ruined
arch, formerly some triumphal record no doubt, and near
it was a shepherd, clad in skins, tending his goats. No
other human sign&mdash;oh, it was delicious and has made
me in love with the very name of Rome. Such swarms
of lizards there were, and so tame, especially the green
ones, which knew I wouldn’t hurt them and so ran on to
my hands. The funniest fly too I ever saw buzzed up,
and sat on a spray of blackthorn blossom and looked at
me: I burst out laughing at it, and it really seemed to
look reproachfully at me&mdash;and for a moment I felt sorry
at being so rude. I could have lain there all day, so delicious
was the silence save for these natural sounds&mdash;and
all these dear little birds and insects. What surprised
me so much about the flowers was not only their immense
quantity, but also their astounding variety. At last I
had to leave, as it is not safe to lie long on the Campagna
if one is tired or hungry. So I strolled along through
the deep grasses and over slope after slope till at last<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
I saw the clump of stone pines which were my landmark,
and then I soon joined the road....”</p>


<p class="pbqr p1"><span class="smcap">Siena</span>, 30th April, 1883.</p>

<div class="pbq">
<p>“You will see by the above address that I have arrived
in this beautiful old city.</p>

<p>I left Rome and arrived in Perugia on Thursday last&mdash;spending
the rest of the day in wandering about the
latter, and watching the sunset over the far-stretching
Umbrian country. I made the acquaintance of some nice
people at the Hotel, and we agreed to share a carriage
for a day&mdash;so early on Friday morning we started in a
carriage and pair for Assisi. About 3 miles from Perugia
we came to the Etruscan tombs, which we spent a
considerable time in exploring: I was much struck with
the symbolism and beauty of the ornamental portions,
Death evidently to the ancient Etrurians being but a
departure elsewhere. The comparative joyousness (exultation,
as in the symbol of the rising sun over the chief
entrance) of the Etruscans contrasts greatly with the
joylessness of the Christians, who have done their best
to make death repellant in its features and horrible in
its significance, its possibilities.</p>

<p><i>Only a Renaissance of belief in the Beautiful being
the only sure guide can save modern nations from further
spiritual degradation</i>&mdash;and not till the gloomy precepts
of Christianity yield to something more akin to the Greek
sense of beauty will life appear to the majority lovely
and wonderful, alike in the present and in the future.</p>

<p>After leaving the Tombs of the Volumnii we drove
along through a most interesting country, beautiful everywhere
owing to Spring’s feet having passed thereover,
till we came to the Church of Sta. Maria degli Angeli&mdash;on
the plain just below Assisi. We went over this, and
then drove up the winding road to the gray old town
itself, visiting, before ascending to the ruined citadel at
the top of the hill, the Chiesa di Santa Chiara. Lying
on the grass on the very summit of the hill, we had lunch,
and then lay looking at the scenery all round us, north,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
south, east, and west. Barren and desolate and colourless,
with neither shade of tree nor coolness of water,
these dreary Assisi hills have nothing of the grandeur
and beauty of the barrenness and desolation of the north&mdash;they
are simply hideous to the eye, inexpressibly
dreary, dead, and accursed. I shall never now hear
Assisi mentioned without a shudder, for picturesque as
the old town is, beautiful as are the Monastery, the Upper
Church, the paintings and the frescoes&mdash;they are overweighted
in my memory with the <i>hideousness</i> of the immediate
hill-surroundings. It made me feel almost sick
and ill, looking from the ruined citadel out upon these
stony, dreary, lifeless, hopeless hills&mdash;and I had again
and again to find relief in the beauty of more immediate
surroundings&mdash;the long grasses waving in the buttresses
of the citadel, the beautiful yellow (absolutely stainless in
colour) wallflowers sprouting from every chink and
cranny, and the green and gray lizards darting everywhere
and shining in the sunlight. Here at least was life,
not death: and to me human death is less painful than
that of nature, for in the former I see but change, but in
the latter&mdash;annihilation. These poor mountains!&mdash;once,
long ago, bright and joyous with colour and sound and
winds and waters and birds&mdash;and now without a tree to
give shadow where grass will never again grow, save
here and there a stunted and withered olive, like some
plague-stricken wretch still lingering amongst the decayed
desolation of his birthplace&mdash;without the music
and light of running water, save, perhaps twice amidst
their parched and serried flanks a crawling, muddy, hideous
<i>liquid</i>; and without sound, save the blast of the
winter-wind and the rattle of dislodged stones.</p>

<p>Yet the day was perfect&mdash;one of those flawless days
combining the laughter of Spring and the breath of ardent
Summer: but perhaps this very perfection accentuates
the desert wretchedness behind the old town of
St. Francis. Yet the very day before I went I was told
that the view from the citadel was lovely (and this not
with reference to the Umbrian prospect in <i>front</i> of Assisi,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
which is fine though to my mind it has been enormously
exaggerated)&mdash;lovely! As well might a person ask me
to look at the divine beauty of the Belvedere Apollo,
and then say to me that lovely also was yon maimed and
hideous beggar, stricken with the foulness of leprosy.</p>

<p>The hills about Assisi beautiful! Oh Pan, Pan, indeed
your music passed long, long ago out of men’s hearing....”</p></div>


<p class="pbqr p1"><span class="smcap">Florence</span>, 7th May.</p>

<div class="pbq">
<p>“On either Wednesday or Thursday last we started
early for Monte Oliveto, and after a long and interesting
drive we came to a rugged and wild country, and
at last, by the side of a deep gorge to the famous Convent
itself. The scenery all round made a great impression
on me&mdash;it was as wild, almost as desolate as the
hills behind Assisi&mdash;but there was nothing repellant, i. e.,
stagnant, about it. While we were having something
to eat outside the convent (a huge building) the abbé
came out and received us most kindly, and brought us
further refreshment in the way of hard bread and wine
and cheese&mdash;their mode of life being too simple to have
anything else to offer.</p>

<p>Owing to the great heat and perhaps over-exposure
while toiling up some of the barren scorched roads, where
they became too hilly or rough for the horses&mdash;I had
succumbed to an agonising nervous headache, and could
do nothing for a while but crouch in a corner of the wall
in the shade and keep wet handkerchiefs constantly over
my forehead and head. In the meantime the others had
gone inside, and as Mrs. S. had told the abbé I was
suffering from a bad headache he came out to see me
and at once said I had had a slight touch of the sun&mdash;a
frequent thing in these scorched and barren solitudes.
He took me into a private room and made me lie down
on a bed&mdash;and in a short time brought me two cups of
strong black coffee, with probably something in it&mdash;for
in less than twenty minutes I could bear the light in my
eyes and in a few minutes more I had only an ordinary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
headache. He was exceedingly kind altogether, and I
shall never think of Monte Oliveto without calling to
remembrance the Abbé Cesareo di Negro. I then spent
about three hours over the famous 35 noble frescoes by
Sodoma and Signorelli, illustrating the life of Saint Benedict,
the founder of the convent. They are exceedingly
beautiful&mdash;and one can learn more from this consecutive
series than can well be imagined. While taking my notes
and wondering how I was to find time (without staying
for a couple of days or so) to take down all particulars&mdash;I
saw the abbé crossing the cloisters in my direction,
and when he joined me he said, “la Signora” had told
him I was a poet and writer, and that I thought more
of Sodoma than any of his contemporaries, and so he
begged me to accept from him a small work in French
on the history of the convent including a fairly complete
account of each fresco. A glance at this showed that
it would be of great service to me, and save much in
the way of note-taking&mdash;and I was moreover glad of this
memento; he inscribed his name in it....</p>

<p>The more I see of Sodoma’s work the more I see
what a great artist he was&mdash;and how enormously underrated
he is in comparison with many others better known
or more talked about. After having done as much as I
could take in, I went with the abbé over other interesting
parts and saw some paintings of great repute, but to me
unutterably wearisome and empty&mdash;and then to the library&mdash;and
finally through the wood to a little chapel with
some interesting frescoes. I felt quite sorry to leave the
good abbé. I promised to send him a copy of whatever
I wrote about the Sodomas&mdash;and he said that whenever
I came to Italy again I was to come and stay there for
a few days, or longer if I liked&mdash;and he hoped I would
not forget but take him at his word. Thinking of you,
I said I supposed ladies could not stay at the Convent&mdash;but
he said they were not so rigorous now, and he would
be glad to see the wife of the young English poet with
him, if she could put up with plain fare and simple
lodging. Altogether, Monte Oliveto made such an impression<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
on me that I won’t be content till I take you
there for a visit of a few days....”</p></div>


<p class="pbqr p1"><span class="smcap">Venezia</span>, 10th May.</p>

<div class="pbq">
<p>“ ... I came here one day earlier than I anticipated.
What can I say! I have no words to express my delight
as to Venice and its surroundings&mdash;it makes up an
hundredfold for my deep disappointment as to Rome. I
am in sympathy with everything here&mdash;the art, the architecture,
the beauty of the city, everything connected
with it, the climate, the brightness and joyousness, and
most of all perhaps the glorious presence of the sea....
From the first moment, I fell passionately and irretrievably
in love with Venice: I should rather be a week here
than a month in Rome or even Florence: the noble city
is the crown of Italy, and fit to be empress of all cities.</p>

<p>All yesterday afternoon and evening (save an hour
on the Piazza and neighbourhood) I spent in a gondola&mdash;enjoying
it immensely: and after dinner I went out
till late at night, listening to the music on the canals.
Curiously, after the canals were almost deserted&mdash;and I
was drifting slowly in a broad stream of moonlight&mdash;a
casement opened and a woman sang with as divine a
voice as in my poem of <i>The Tides of Venice</i>: she was also
such a woman as there imagined&mdash;and I felt that the
poem was a true forecast. Early this morning I went
to the magnificent St. Mark’s (not only infinitely nobler
than St. Peter’s, but to me more impressive than all the
Churches in Rome taken together). I then went to the
Lido, and had a glorious swim in the heavy sea that was
rolling in. On my return I found that Addington Symonds
had called on me&mdash;and I am expecting W. D. Howells.
I had also a kind note from Ouida.</p>

<p>Life, joyousness, brightness everywhere&mdash;oh, I am
so happy! I wish I were a bird, so that I could sing
out the joy and delight in my heart. After the oppression
of Rome, the ghastliness of Assisi, the heat and dust
of Florence&mdash;Venice is like Paradise. Summer is everywhere
here&mdash;on the Lido there were hundreds of butterflies,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
lizards, bees, birds, and some heavenly larks&mdash;a
perfect glow and tumult of life&mdash;and I shivered with
happiness. The cool fresh joyous wind blew across the
waves white with foam and gay with the bronze-sailed
fisher-boats&mdash;the long wavy grass was sweet-scented and
delicious&mdash;the acacias were in blossom of white&mdash;life&mdash;dear,
wonderful, changeful, passionate, joyous life everywhere!
I shall never forget this day&mdash;never, never.
Don’t despise me when I tell you that once it overcame
me, quite; but the tears were only from excess of happiness,
from the passionate delight of getting back again
to the Mother whom I love in Nature, with her wind-caresses
and her magic breath.”</p>

<p class="p2">The weeks in Venice gave my correspondent the crowning
pleasure of his Italian sojourn; Venetian art appealed
to him beyond that of any other school. The
frequent companionship of John Addington Symonds,
the long hours in the gondola, in the near and distant
lagoons were a perpetual joy to him. June he spent in
the Ardennes with my mother and me&mdash;at Dinant, at
Anseremme and at La Roche. They were happy days
which we spent chiefly in a little boat sailing up the
Lesse, dragging it over the shallows, or resting in the
green shade of oak and beech trees.</p>

<p>In July he was once more in London and hard at work.
Among other things he had contributed a series of articles
on the Etrurian Cities to the <i>Glasgow Herald</i>, and
followed them with letters descriptive of the Ardennes,
then relatively little known. In August he packed all
his Italian notes, and joined his mother and sisters at
Innellan on the Clyde, and later he visited Sir Noel Paton
in Arran, whence he wandered over many of his old loved
haunts in Loch Fyne, in Mull and in Iona.</p>

<p>On his way back to London&mdash;where he was to take up
his work as Art Critic to the <i>Glasgow Herald</i>&mdash;a serious
misadventure befell him. His portmanteau with all his
precious Italian photographs, notes and other MSS. was
lost. Nowhere could he trace it, and he had to return<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
without it. He was in despair; for it meant not only the
loss of material for future commissions, but the loss of
work already finished, and in process.</p>

<p>It was a wet August; and his search through the various
places he had passed on the Clyde was made in
pouring rain. Again and again on the steamers and on
the piers he was soaked during those miserable days.
He settled in London at 13 Thorngate Road, Sutherland
Gardens, in deep depression; his persistent appeals
to the Railway Company were unavailing. As the autumn
advanced his old enemy rheumatism took hold of
him, and he was laid low again with rheumatic fever,
which this time attacked his heart mainly. His sister
Mary came up to town and she and I nursed him. The
best tonic however toward recovery was the reappearance
of the lost portmanteau with its much mourned
over contents in a soaked and sodden condition, but still
legible and serviceable.</p>

<p>In the Introduction to a selection of Philip Marston’s
Poems my husband relates that:</p>

<p>“During the spring months of 1884 I was residing at
Dover, and in April Marston came down from London
to spend a week or so with me. The weather was perfect,
and our walks by shore and cliff were full of delight
to us both. Once or twice we crossed to Calais for
the sake of the sail, and spent a few hours in the old
French port, and returned by the afternoon boat. In
the evenings, after dinner, we invariably adjourned to
the beach, either under the eastern bluffs, or along the
base of Shakespeare’s Cliff, for the music of the sea, in
calm or tidal turbulence or tempest, had an unfailing
fascination for him.</p>

<p>“He took keen pleasure in learning how to distinguish
the songs of the different birds, and all spring’s sounds
and scents were sources of exquisite pleasure. How well
I remember the rapt expression of puzzled delight which
animated his face, as one day we crossed some downs
to the westward of Folkestone. ‘Oh, what is that?’ he
cried eagerly; and to my surprise I found that what had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
so excited him was the crying of the young lambs as they
stumbled or frisked about their mothers. He had so
seldom been out of London in early spring that so common
an incident as this had all the charm of newness to
him.</p>

<p>“A frisky youngster was eagerly enticed alongside,
and the blind poet’s almost childlike happiness in playing
with the woolly little creature was something delightful
to witness. A little later I espied one which had only
been a few hours in the world, and speedily placed it in
his arms. He would fain have carried it away with him:
in his tender solicitude for it he was like a mother over
her first-born.</p>

<p>“As we turned to walk homeward we met a boy holding
a young starling in his hand. Its feeble strident
cries, its funny little beak closing upon his finger under
the impression it was a gigantic worm, delighted him
almost as much as the lambkin. ‘A day of days!’ was
his expressive commentary, as tired and hungry we
reached home and sat down to dinner, with the deep
boom of the sea clearly audible through the open window.”</p></div>

<p class="p1">From Dover W. S. went to Paris for the first time in
his capacity as Art Critic, and thoroughly enjoyed himself
as this letter to me shows:</p>


<p class="pbqr p1"><span class="smcap">Paris</span>, 10th April, 1884.</p>

<div class="pbq">
<p>What remains of me after to-day’s heat now writes to
you. This morning I spent half an hour or so in M.
Bourget’s study&mdash;and was flattered to find a well-read
copy of my <i>Rossetti</i> there. He had a delightful library
of books, and, for a Frenchman, quite a respectable number
by English writers: amongst other things, I was most
interested in seeing a shelf of about 30 volumes with
letters or inscriptions inside from the corresponding contemporary
critics, philosophists, etc. M. Bourget is fortunate
in his friends.</p>

<p>I then went to breakfast with him at a famous Café,
frequented chiefly by <i>hommes de lettres</i>. At our table we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
were soon joined by Hennequin and two others. After
breakfast (a most serious matter!) I adjourned with
Bourget to his club, La Société Historique, Cercle St.
Simon, and while there was introduced to one or two
people, and made an honorary member with full privileges.
I daresay Bourget’s name is better known to you
as a poet, but generally his name is more familiar as the
author of “Essais de Psychologie Contemporaine”&mdash;an
admirable series of studies on the works and genius of
Baudelaire, Renan, Gustave Flaubert, Taine, and Stendhal.
He very kindly gave me a copy (which I am glad to
have from him, though I knew the book already) and
in it he wrote</p>

<p class="pi10">À William Sharp</p>
<p class="pi12">de son confrère</p>
<p class="pi14">Paul Bourget.</p>

<p class="p1">After leaving him I recrossed the Champs Elysées&mdash;perspired
so freely that the Seine perceptibly rose&mdash;sank
exhausted on a seat at the Café de la Paix&mdash;dwelt in
ecstasy while absorbing a <i>glace aux pistaches</i>&mdash;then went
back to the Grand Hotel&mdash;and to my room, where after
a bit I set to and finished my concluding Grosvenor Gallery
Notice.</p>

<p>On Sunday, if I can manage it, I will go to Mdme. Blavatsky.</p>

<p>On Monday Bourget comes here for me at twelve, and
we breakfast together (he with me this time)&mdash;and I
then go to M. Lucien Mariex, who is to take and introduce
me to M. Muntz, the writer of the best of the many books
on Raphael and an influential person in the Bibliothèque
Nationale. Somebody else is to take me to look at some
of the private treasures in the École des Beaux Arts. In
the course of the week I am to see Alphonse Daudet, and
Bourget is going to introduce me to Émile Zola. As
early as practicable I hope to get to Neuilly to see M.
Milsand, but don’t know when. If practicable I am also
to meet François Coppée (the chief living French poet
after Victor Hugo)&mdash;also M. M. Richepin, F. Mistral<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
(author of <i>Miréio</i>), and one or two others. Amongst
artists I am looking forward to meeting Bouguereau,
Cormin, Puvis de Chavannes, and Jules Breton. As
much as any one else, I look forward to making the acquaintance
of Guizot to whose house I am going shortly
with M. Bourget. There is really a delightful fraternity
here amongst the literary and artistic world. And every
one seems to want to do something for me, and I feel as
much flattered as I am pleased. Of course my introductions
have paved the way, and, besides, Bourget has
said a great deal about me as a writer&mdash;too much, I
know.”</p></div>

<p class="p2">The two important events of 1884 were the publication
of a second volume of Poems, and our marriage.</p>

<p>In June <i>Earth’s Voices</i> (Elliot Stock) was issued and
was well received at home and in America. In an article
on William Sharp and Fiona Macleod written for
<i>The Century</i> in 1906 Mr. Ernest Rhys wrote of this
volume:</p>

<p>“There was an impassioned delight in nature&mdash;in nature
at large, that is&mdash;in her seas and skies, or in her
scenery subjectively coloured by lyric emotion to be
found in these early books.</p>

<p>“Perhaps one of his Northern poems may best serve to
illustrate his faculty; and there is one that is particularly
to the purpose, since it sketches ‘Moonrise’ from
the very spot&mdash;Iona&mdash;with which so many of the ‘Fiona’
tales and fantasies were to be connected afterward.</p>

<p class="ppn6 p1">Here where in dim forgotten days,<br />
A savage people chanted lays<br />
To long since perished gods, I stand:<br />
The sea breaks in, runs up the sand,<br />
Retreats as with a long-drawn sigh,<br />
Sweeps in again, again leaves dry<br />
The ancient beach, so old and yet<br />
So new that as the strong tides fret<br />
The island barriers in their flow<br />
The ebb hours of each day can know<br />
A surface change. The day is dead,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>The Sun is set, and overhead<br />
The white north stars set keen and bright;<br />
The wind upon the sea is light<br />
And just enough to stir the deep<br />
With phosphorescent gleams and sweep<br />
The spray from salt waves as they rise.</p>

<p class="p1">“Sharp’s early work is more like that of a lyric improvisator
than of a critical modern poet. At this period
he cared more for the free colours of verse than for exact
felicity of phrase. His writings betrayed a constant
quest after those hardly realisable regions of thought,
and those keener lyric emotions, which, since Shelley
wrote and Rossetti wrote and painted, have so often occupied
the interpreters of the vision and spectacle of nature.</p>

<p>“One may find this variously attempted or half expressed
in several of the poems of his second book. In
one called ‘A Record’ (to which a special inscription
drew attention in the copy he sent me), he treats very
fancifully the mystery of transmigration. He pictures
himself sitting in his room, and there he resumes the
lives, and states of being, of many savage types of man
and beast viewed in passion and action&mdash;the tiger, the
eagle, and the primitive man who lighted the fire that
consumed the dry scrub and his fellow-tribesmen:</p>

<p class="ppn6 p1">He looks around to see some god,<br />
And far upon the fire-scorched sod<br />
He sees his brown-burnt tribesmen lie,<br />
And thinks their voices fill the sky,<br />
And dreads some unseen sudden blow&mdash;<br />
And even as I watch him, lo,<br />
My savage-self I seem to know.</p>

<p class="p1">“Or again he reincarnates the Druid:</p>

<p class="ppn6 p1">And dreaming so I dream my dream:<br />
I see a flood of moonlight gleam<br />
Between vast ancient oaks, and round<br />
A rough-hewn altar on the ground<br />
Weird Druid priests are gathered<br />
While through their midst a man is led<br />
With face that seems already dead.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1">“And again the type is changed into a Shelleyan recluse,
a hermit who had had retreated to his cave, and
that hermit</p>

<p class="ppn6 p1">Was even that soul mine eyes have traced<br />
Through brute and savage steadily,<br />
That he even now is part of me<br />
Just as a wave is of the sea.</p>

<p class="p1">“If there are traces of Shelley in this poem, Rossetti
and Swinburne have also their echo in some of its rhapsodic,
highly figurative stanzas. There are unmistakable
germs in it, too, of some of the supernatural ideas that
afterward received a much more vital expression in
‘Fiona Macleod’s’ work.”</p>

<p>The volume was dedicated to his friend Walter Pater
and from him and other writers and friends he received
many interesting letters, and from them I select the following:</p>


<p class="pbqr p1"><span class="smcap">2 Bradmore Road</span>, May 28th.</p>

<p class="pn"><span class="smcap">My dear Sharp</span>,</p>

<p class="pbq">I was just thinking of sending off my long-delayed
acknowledgment of your charming volume, with its
friendly dedication (which I take as a great compliment,
and sincerely thank you for) when your post card arrived.
These new poems must, I feel sure, add much
to your poetic reputation. I have just finished my first
reading of them; but feel that I shall have to go back
many times to appreciate all their complex harmonies
of sense and rhythm. On a first superficial reading, I
incline to think that the marks of power cluster most
about the poem of <i>Sospitra</i>. Also, I prefer the <i>Transcripts
from Nature</i>, to the various poems included in
<i>Earth’s Voices</i>, admirable as I think many of the latter
to be, e. g., The Song of the Flowers, The Field Mouse,
The Song of the Thrush, The Cry of the Tiger, The Chant
of the Lion, The Hymn of the Autumn. This looks
shamefully matter-of-fact. But then, you asked me to
tell you precisely which I preferred. <i>The Shadowed
Souls</i>, among the short pieces, I find very beautiful. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
whole volume seems to me distinguishable among latter-day
poetry for its cheerfulness and animation, and of
course the Australian pieces are delightfully novel and
fresh. Many thanks, again, from</p>

<p class="pr6 reduct">Yours very sincerely,</p>
<p class="pr4 reduct"><span class="smcap">Walter H. Pater</span>.</p>


<p class="p1">In an article on Christina Rossetti, William Sharp relates:</p>

<p>“In the beginning of May, 1884, I called to see Miss
Rossetti and to leave with her a copy of a just-published
volume of verse, but failed to find her at home. The
poem I cared most for was the epilogue, <i>Madonna Natura</i>,
but instinct told me Miss Rossetti would neither
like nor approve so pagan an utterance, and the surmise
was correct:</p>


<p class="pr5 p1 reduct"><span class="smcap">30 Torrington Square, W. C.</span>,</p>
<p class="pr4 reduct">May 3, 1884.</p>

<p class="pn"><span class="smcap">Dear Mr. Sharp</span>,</p>

<div class="pbq">
<p>I might say “Why do you call just when we are out?”
only that you might retort “Why are you out just when
I call?”</p>

<p>Thank you very much for your new volume and yet
more for the kindness which enriches the gift. Be sure
my Mother and I retain you in friendly remembrance.</p>

<p>An imperfect acquaintance with your text inclines me
for the present to prefer “the Thames” amongst rivers,
and the “West” among winds, and the “Thrush” among
song-birds. So also “Deserts” to “Cornfields.”</p>

<p>Of course all the pieces which memorialise our dear
Gabriel interest us.</p>

<p>And “Ah Sin” I like and sympathise with: and I fear
it is only too lifelike. Shall I or shall I not say anything
about “Madre Natura”? I dare say without my taking
the liberty of expressing myself you can (if you think it
worth while) put my regret into words.</p></div>

<p class="pr6 reduct">Very truly yours,</p>
<p class="pr4 reduct"><span class="smcap">Christina G. Rossetti</span>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1">“Though I cannot recall what I wrote, write I did evidently,
and obviously also with eagerness to prove that,
while I accepted her gentle reproof in the spirit in which
she offered it, I held the point of view immaterial; and no
doubt a very crude epistle it was in thought and diction....”</p>

<p>That summer my Poet and I were very happy receiving
the congratulations from our friends on the approaching
termination of our nine years of waiting. We were
married on a Friday the 31st October 1884 at Christ
Church, Lancaster Gate, and his friend Eric S. Robertson&mdash;Editor
of The Great Writer Series, and afterward Professor
of Literature and Logic at Lahore Government
College&mdash;acted as best man. Mrs. Craik lent us her
house at Dover for our honeymoon, and we also made a
flying visit to Paris.</p>

<p>The end of November found us settled in a little house
in Talgarth Road, West Kensington (No. 46): our relatives
furnished the house for us and we began our new
life with high hopes and a slender purse. My husband
had £30 in his pocket, and I had an income of £35
a year.</p>

<p>Among the many kindly letters of congratulations came
one from Mr. Addington Symonds.</p>


<p class="pbqr p1">
<span class="smcap">Davos Platz</span>, Dec. 22, 1884.</p>

<p class="pn"><span class="smcap">My dear Mr. Sharp</span>,</p>

<div class="pbq">
<p>Allow me first to congratulate you on your marriage,
and settlement in London. You will remember that I was
privileged at Venice to see a volume of your “Transcripts
from Nature,” in relation to which you told me
of your engagement. I am therefore interested to hear
of the happy event, and wish both you and Mrs. Sharp
all the prosperity, which it is possible for mortals to
enjoy! When I come to London (which I hope to do
next year) I shall not forget your kind invitation.</p>

<p>I must give you most hearty thanks for the enjoyment
of a rare delight in your post-card and letter about my
Sonnets. I have so high an esteem of your own original<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
work in poetry that to be appreciated by you is no common
pleasure. Such words as yours are more than many
of the ordinary reviews, even if kindly; and they take
the annoyance away, which some unjust and ignorant
critiques leave upon a sensitive mind.</p>

<p>If it were not that men like yourself, who have the
right and power to judge, speak thus from time to time,
I do not think I should care to go on publishing what I
take pleasure in producing, but what has hitherto brought
me no gains and caused me to receive some kicks. It is
indeed very good of you amid your pressing literary
occupations and the more delightful interests of your
life at present, to find time to tell me what you really
value in my work. Thank you for noticing the omission
of the comma after <i>islands</i> in Sonnet on p. 38 of
Vag: Lit:</p>

<p>It has fallen out accidentally; and if such a remarkable
event as a 2nd. edn. occurs, it shall be replaced. So also
will I alter what you rightly point out as a blemish in
the Sonnet on p. 200&mdash;the repetition of <i>deep deep</i> and
<i>sleep</i> in the same line. That was questioned by my own
ear. I left it thus because I thought it added a sort of
oppressive dreaminess to the opening of the Sonnet, striking
a keynote. But if it has struck you as wrong, I doubt
not that it should be altered; since it will not have
achieved the purposed effect. And those effects are after
all tricks.</p>

<p>I shall also attend to your suggestions about future
work. I have had it in my mind to continue the theme of
“Animi Figura,” and to attempt to show how a character
which has reached apparent failure in moral and spiritual
matters may reconstruct a life’s philosophy and find sufficient
sources of energy and health. There is no doubt
great difficulty in this motif. But were it possible to
succeed in some such adumbration of what the Germans
call a Versöhnung, then the purgation of the passions at
which a work of art should aim would be effected. Believe
me, with renewed thanks, to be very sincerely yours,</p></div>

<p class="p1">Many were the pleasant literary households that gave
a welcome to us, and in particular those of Mr. and Mrs.

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER VI</h2>

<p class="pch">SONNETS OF THIS CENTURY</p>


<p>1885 was a year of hard work. It was our desire that
such work should be done that should eventually make it
possible for my husband to devote himself exclusively to
original work&mdash;perhaps in a year or two at most. Meanwhile
the outlook was satisfactory and encouraging. He
held the post of London Art-Critic to the <i>Glasgow Herald</i>,
was on the staff of <i>The Academy</i> then under the
Editorship of his good friend Mr. James Cotton; and he
wrote for <i>The Examiner</i>, <i>The Athenaeum</i> and other
weeklies.</p>

<p>On the appearance in <i>The Athenaeum</i> of his Review on
<i>Marius the Epicurean</i> the author expressed his satisfaction
in a letter:</p>


<p class="pr5 p1 reduct"><span class="smcap">2 Bradmore Road</span>,</p>
<p class="pr4 reduct">March 1, 1885.</p>

<p class="pn"><span class="smcap">My dear Sharp</span>,</p>

<p class="pbq">I have read your article in <i>The Athenaeum</i> with very
real pleasure; feeling criticism, at once so independent
and so sympathetic, to be a reward for all the long labours
the book has cost me. You seem to me to have struck a
note or criticism not merely pleasant but judicious; and
there are one or two important points&mdash;literary ones&mdash;on
which you have said precisely what I should have wished,
and thought it important for me, to have said. Thank
you sincerely for your friendly work! Also, for your
letter, and promise of the other notices, which I shall
look out for, and greatly value. I was much pleased
also that Mrs. Sharp had been so much interested in my
writing. It is always a sign to me that I have to some
extent succeeded in my literary aim when I gain the
approval of accomplished women.</p>

<p class="pbq">I should be glad, and feel it a great compliment, to have
Marius translated into German, on whatever terms your
friend likes&mdash;provided of course that Macmillan approves.
I will ask him his views on this point. As regards
the ethical drift of Marius, I should like to talk
to you, if you were here. I <i>did</i> mean it to be more anti-Epicurean
than it has struck you as being. In one way
however I am glad that you have mistaken me a little on
this point, as I had some fears that I might seem to be
pleading for a formal thesis, or “parti pris.” Be assured
how cheering your praise&mdash;praise from so genuine
and accomplished a fellow-workman&mdash;has been to me.
Such recognition is especially a help to one whose work
is so exclusively personal and solitary as the kind of literary
work, which I feel I can do best, must be. I fancied
you spoke of bringing your wife to Oxford this term;
and wish we had a room to offer you. But I think you
know that we have at most only room for a single visitor.
It will however give my sisters great pleasure to make
the acquaintance of Mrs. Sharp. Only let us know a
week or so, if possible, before you come to Oxford, that
we may see as much of you as possible: and with our
united kind regards, believe me, my dear Sharp,</p>

<p class="pr6 reduct">Very sincerely yours,</p>
<p class="pr4 reduct"><span class="smcap">Walter Pater</span>.</p>

<p class="p1">I hope that in generosity to me you are not wasting
too much of the time that belongs to your own original
work. I have told Macmillan to send you a properly
bound copy of Marius, with only a few misprints.</p>

<p class="p2">Mr. Theodore Watts had frequently spoken to us about
a romance he had in hand, and partly in print. After
much persuasion he sent several chapters of <i>Aylwin</i> to
us during our summer holiday, and we read them on the
shores of West Loch Tarbert in Argyll with keen enjoyment.
An enthusiastic letter from the younger author
brought this reply:</p>

<p class="pn"><span class="smcap">My dear Sharp</span>,</p>

<div class="pbq">
<p>My best thanks for your most kind and suggestive letter.
I am much gratified to know that in you and Mrs.
Sharp I have true sympathisers in a story which although
it may and I hope will be generally popular, can only
deeply appeal to the heart of hearts of here and there one
of the true romantic temper. Swinburne, who has read
it all, tells me that the interest grows sharply and steadily
to the very end and the finest volume is the last.</p>

<p>You are right in your surmise as to the rapidity in
which the story was written to dictation. Both its merits
and its defects you will find to arise from the fact that
the conception came to me as one whole and that my
eagerness to pour it out while the imagination was at
white heat conquered everything. I doubt if it ever <i>could</i>
have been written save to dictation. When do you return?</p>

<p class="p1">In the article written for <i>The Century Magazine</i>, 1907,
on William Sharp and Fiona Macleod, Mr. Ernest Rhys
gives a reminiscent description of the young author and
of his impressions of him, on their first acquaintance:</p>

<div class="pbq">
<p class="p1">“One summer morning, some twenty years ago, in
Cheyne Walk, Chelsea, I was called down to an early
visitor, and found waiting me a superb young man&mdash;a
typical Norseman, as I should have thought him&mdash;tall,
yellow-haired, blue-eyed. His cheeks were as rosy as a
young girl’s, his manners as frank and impulsive as a
boy’s. He had come with an introduction from a common
friend (Mrs. William Bell Scott), a would-be contributor
to a new periodical; but he soon passed from the
discussion of an article on De Quincey to an account of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
himself that was joyously and consciously exuberant.
He told of adventures in Australian backwoods, and of
intrigues in Italy that recalled Cellini; and then he
turned, with the same rapid flow of brief staccato sentences,
to speak of his friend Mr. Swinburne’s new volume
of poems, or of the last time he walked along Cheyne
Walk to spend an evening with Rossetti. He appeared to
know everybody, to have been everywhere. Finally,
though he had apparently been sitting up all the night before
to write an epic or a ‘Quarterly’ article, he was
quite ready to start the same evening for Paris, not only
to be present at a new play there, but in order to be able
to talk, hours on end in the dark, about the ‘Contes
Extraordinaires’ of M. Ernest Hello, or about a very
different and still more wonderful being, then little
known in London, called Nietzsche.</p>

<p>“It is not easy to avoid extravagance in speaking of
one who was in all things an illusionist. Sharp’s sensations,
doings, artistic ideas, and performances were not
to be counted by rule and measure. He was capable of
predicting a new religion as he paced the Thames Embankment,
or of devising an imaginary new theatre for
romantic drama&mdash;whose plays were yet to be written (by
himself)&mdash;as he rode home from the Haymarket.</p>

<p>“Before we separated, at that first meeting, he had
made more plans for events and new great works than
the most sanguine of imaginers and writers could hope
to effect in a lifetime. And, alas! for his control of circumstance,
within a fortnight I was summoned to his
sick-bed. He was down with scarlet fever, and it fell to
me to write from his notes, or otherwise to complete,
more than one essay and review which he had undertaken
before he fell ill....</p>

<p>“There was another side to William Sharp. He had
a spirit of fun, boyish mischief even, which found the
slightest reflection in his work; for his writing is not remarkable
for its humour. His extravagance of energy,
which vehemently sped his pen, led him, in the course of
his earlier life, into a hundred wild exploits. To him a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
piece of writing was an adventure. He delighted in impossible
feats of composition, such as trying to finish a
whole romance between sunset and sunrise. It follows
that, with all this huge impetuosity, he was a poet who
was rather disinclined by temperament for the ‘poetic
pains.’ What he wrote in haste he was not always anxious
to correct at leisure; and he was happy about what
he wrote&mdash;at any rate, until a colder mood supervened at
some later stage of his development.</p>

<p>“In keeping with this mental restlessness, Sharp was
an insatiable wanderer. No sooner did he reach London
than he was intriguing to be off again. Some of his
devices in order to get work done, and to equip these
abrupt expeditions, were as absurd as anything told by
Henri Murger. Thanks to his large and imposing presence,
his sanguine air, his rosy faith in himself, he had a
way of overwhelming editors that was beyond anything, I
believe, ever heard of in London, before or since. On
one occasion he went into a publisher’s office, and gave
so alluring an account of a long-meditated book that the
publisher gave him a check for £100, although he had
not written a word of it.</p>

<p>“These things illustrate his temperament. He was a
romanticist, an illusionist. He did not see places or men
and women as they were; he did not care to see them so:
but he had quite peculiar powers of assimilating to himself
foreign associations&mdash;the ideas, the colours, the current
allusions, of foreign worlds. In Italy he became an
Italian in spirit; in Algiers, an Arab. On his first visit to
Sicily he could not be happy because of the sense of
bloodshed and warfare associated with the scenes amid
which he was staying; he saw bloodstains on the earth,
on every leaf and flower.</p>

<p>“The same susceptibility marked his intercourse with
his fellows. Their sensations and emotions, their whims,
their very words, were apt to become his, and to be reproduced
with an uncanny reality in his own immediate practice.
It was natural, then, that he should be doubly sensitive
to feminine intuitions; that he should be able, even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
on occasion, thanks to an extreme concern with women’s
inevitable burdens and sufferings, to translate, as men
are very rarely able to do, their intimate dialect.”</p></div>

<p class="p1">The description given by Mr. Rhys of William Sharp’s
method of work as characterised by an impetuosity
which made him “disinclined for the poetic pains” belonged
to one phase of his development. During the
early days of hard work for the bare necessities of life, he
had little time to devote to the writing of poetry or of
purely imaginative work. His literary efforts were directed
toward the shaping of his prose critical writings,
toward the controlled exercise of the mental faculties
which belonged to the William Sharp’s side of himself.
From time to time the emotional, the more intimate self
would sweep aside all conscious control; a dream, a sudden
inner vision, an idea that had lain dormant in what
he called “the mind behind the mind” would suddenly
visualise itself and blot out everything else from his consciousness,
and under such impulse he would write at
great speed, hardly aware of what or how he wrote, so
absorbed was he in the vision with which for the moment
he was identified. In those days he was unwilling to retouch
such writing; for he thought that revision should
be made only under a similar phase of emotion. Consequently
he preferred for the most part to destroy such
efforts if the result seemed quite inadequate, rather than
alter them. Later, when that side of his nature found
expression in the Fiona Macleod writings&mdash;when those
impulses became more frequent, more reliable, more coherent&mdash;he
changed his attitude toward the question of
revision, and desired above all things to give as beautiful
an expression as lay in his power to what to him were
dreams of beauty.</p>

<p>For his critical work, however, he studied and prepared
himself deliberately. He believed that the one
method of attaining to a balanced estimate of our literature
is by a comparative study of foreign contemporary
writing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span></p>

<p>“The more interested I became in literature,” he on
one occasion explained to an interviewer, “the more convinced
I grew of the narrowness of English criticism and
of the importance to the English critic of getting away
from the insular point of view. So I decided that the
surest way of beginning to prepare myself for the work
of the critic would be to make a study of three or four
of the best writers among the older, and three or four
among the younger school of each nation, and to judge
from the point of view of the nation. For example, in
studying French literature, I would try to judge from the
point of view of a Frenchman. When this task was done
I tried to estimate the literature under consideration
from an absolute impersonal and impartial point of view.
Of course, this study took a long time, but it furnished
me material that has been invaluable to me in my work
ever since.”</p>

<p>It was his constant endeavour to understand the underlying
motive in any phase of modern literature; and
he believed that “what is new in literature is not so
likely to be unfit for critics, as critics are likely to be unfit
for what is new in literature.” Concerning the art of
Criticism he expressed his belief in an unfinished article:
“When I speak of Criticism I have in mind not merely
the more or less deft use of commentary or indication, but
one of the several ways of literature and in itself a rare
and fine art, the marriage of science that knows, and of
spirit that discerns.”</p>

<p>“The basis of Criticism is imagination: its spiritual
quality is sympathy: its intellectual distinction is balance.”</p>

<p>The occasion of his visit to Mr. Ernest Rhys was in
connection with a scheme for the publication of two series
of cheap re-issues of fine literature&mdash;a comparatively new
venture five-and-twenty years ago&mdash;to be published by
Messrs. Walter Scott: <i>The Camelot Classics</i> to be edited
by Ernest Rhys and to consist of selected prose writings,
and <i>The Canterbury Poets</i> to be edited by William
Sharp;&mdash;Each volume to be prefaced by a specially written<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
introduction. For the Prose Series William Sharp
prepared De Quincey’s <i>Confessions of an Opium Eater</i>,
and Mrs. Cunningham’s <i>Great English Painters</i>. For a
third series&mdash;Biographies of <i>Great Writers</i> edited by
Eric S. Robertson and Frank T. Marzial, he wrote his
monographs on Shelley in 1887, on Heine in 1888 and on
Browning in 1890.</p>

<p>Meanwhile he contributed a volume from time to time
to <i>The Canterbury Poets</i>, among others: Collections of
Shakespeare’s Sonnets, Great Odes, American Sonnets,
and his Collection of English Sonnets. In preparing
the Edition of Shakespeare’s Sonnets he consulted Mr.
Edward Dowden on one or two points and received the
following reply:</p>


<p class="pbqr p1"><span class="smcap">Davos Platz</span>, Dec. 6, 1885.</p>

<p class="pn"><span class="smcap">Dear Mr. Sharp</span>,</p>

<div class="pbq">
<p>The most welcome gift of your <i>Songs, Poems and Sonnets</i>
of Shakespeare reached me to-night. I have already
looked it quickly through, and have seen enough to know
that this volume will be my constant companion in future
upon all my wanderings. Comparisons are odious.
So I will not make a list of the other travelling companions,
which your edition of Shakespeare’s lyrics is destined
to supersede.</p>

<p>I will only tell you <i>why</i> yours has the right to supersede
them. First and foremost, it is more scientifically
complete.</p>

<p>Secondly, it is invaluable in its preservation of the
play-atmosphere, by such introductory snatches as you
insert e. g. on p. 20. Hitherto, we had often yearned in
our Shakespearean anthologies for a whiff of the play
from which the songs were torn. You have given
this just where it was needed, and else not. That is
<i>right</i>.</p>

<p>Thirdly, the Preface (to my mind at least) is more
humanly and humanely true about Shakespeare’s attitude
in the Sonnets than anything which has yet been
written about them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span></p>

<p>(I thank you, par parenthèse, for “the <i>vox humana</i> of
Hamlet!”) And apropos of p. 11, I think you might
have mentioned François Victor Hugo’s translation of
Shakespeare’s Sonnets. It is a curious piece of French
criticism. But the main thing left upon my mind by this
first cursory perusal is that you are one of those who
live (as Goethe has for ever put it) in “<i>the whole</i>.” It
is the great thing for modern criticism to get itself up
out of holes and corners, mere personal proclivities and
scholarly niceties, into the large air of nature and of
man.</p>

<p>The critic who does this, has to sacrifice the applause
of coteries and the satisfaction which comes from “discovering”
something and making for his discovery a following.</p>

<p>But I am sure this is the right line for criticism, and
the one which will ultimately prevail, to the exclusion
of more partial ways.</p>

<p>I therefore, who, in my own humble way, have
tried as critic to preserve what Goethe also calls the
“abiding relations,” <i>bleibende Verhältnisse</i>, feel specially
drawn to your work by the seal of largeness set
upon it.</p>

<p>You test Shakespeare in his personal poems as man,
from the standpoint of the whole; and this seems to me
eminently scientific&mdash;right. In a minor point, I can tell
you, as no one else could, that your critical instinct is no
less <i>acute</i> than generally right. You have quoted one of
my sonnets in the notes. This Sonnet was written, to
myself consciously, under the Shakespearean influence.
The influence was complex, but very potent; and your
discernment, your “spotting” of it, appears to me that you
have the right scent&mdash;fiuto (as Italians) flair (as Frenchmen
call that subtle penetration into the recesses of a
mind regulated by style).</p>

<p>Thank you from my heart for this gift, which (I hope,
if years enough are given me) shall wear itself out in the
daily service of your friend,</p></div>

<p class="pbqr"><span class="smcap">John Addington Symonds</span>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1">In the following letter to Mr. Symonds the Editor explained
the intention of his collected <i>Sonnets of this Century</i>:</p>


<p class="pbqr p1">12: 11: 85.</p>

<p class="pn"><span class="smcap">My dear Mr. Symonds</span>,</p>

<div class="pbq">
<p>I am shortly going to bring out a Selection of the Best
Sonnets of this Century (including a lengthy Introductory
Essay on the Sonnet as a vehicle of poetic thought,
and on its place and history in English Literature)&mdash;and
I should certainly regard it as incomplete if your fine
sonnet-work were unrepresented. I am giving an average
of <i>two</i> to each writer of standing, but in your case
I have allowed for <i>five</i>. This is both because I have a
genuine admiration for your sonnet-work in the main,
and because I think that you have never been done full
justice to as a poet&mdash;though of course you have met with
loyal recognition in most of those quarters where you
would most value it....</p>

<p>I have taken great pleasure in the preparation of the
little book, and I think that both poetically and technically
it will be found satisfactory. My main principles in
selection have been (1) Structural correctness. (2) Individuality,
with distinct poetic value. (3) Adequacy of
Sonnet-Motive.</p>

<p>I hope that you are hard at work&mdash;not neglecting the
shyest and dearest of the muses&mdash;? Is there any chance
of your being in London in the late Spring? I hope so.</p></div>

<p class="pr6 reduct">Sincerely yours,</p>
<p class="pr4 reduct"><span class="smcap">William Sharp</span>.</p>

<p class="p1">In the preparation of the volume he received several
interesting communications from well-known English
sonnet writers from which I select four. The first is from
the Irish poet Aubrey de Vere; in the second Mr. George
Meredith answers a question concerning his volume of
sequent poems, <i>Modern Love</i>:</p>


<p class="pr5 p1 reduct"><span class="smcap">Curragh Chase, Adare</span>,</p>
<p class="pr4 reduct">Dec. 5, 1885.</p>

<p class="pn"><span class="smcap">Dear Mr. Sharp</span>,</p>

<p class="pbq">... I am much flattered by what you say about my
sonnets, and glad that you like them; but I hope that in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
selecting so many as five for your volume you have not
displaced sonnets by other authors. Sir R. Hamilton’s
are indeed, as you remark, excellent, and I rejoice that
you are making them better known than they have been
hitherto. Wordsworth once remarked to me that he had
known many men of high talents and several of real
genius; but that Coleridge, and Sir W. H. Hamilton were
the only men he had known to whom he would apply the
term “wonderful.”</p>

<p class="pr6 reduct">Yours faithfully,</p>
<p class="pr4 reduct"><span class="smcap">Aubrey de Vere</span>.</p>


<p class="pr5 p1 reduct"><span class="smcap">Boxhill, Dorking</span>,</p>
<p class="pr4 reduct">Nov. 12, 1885.</p>

<p class="pn"><span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,</p>

<p class="pbq">You are at liberty to make your use of the Sonnet you
have named. The Italians allow of 16 lines, under the
title of “Sonnets with a tail.”</p>

<p class="pbq">But the lines of “Modern Love” were not designed for
that form.</p>

<p class="pr6 reduct">Yours very truly,</p>
<p class="pr4 reduct"><span class="smcap">George Meredith</span>.</p>

<p class="p1">The third letter is from Mr. Theodore Watts-Dunton:</p>


<p class="pr5 p1 reduct"><span class="smcap">The Pines, Putney Hill</span>,</p>
<p class="pr4 reduct">Jan. 8, 1886.</p>

<p class="pn"><span class="smcap">My dear Sharp</span>,</p>

<p class="pbq">I sent off the proofs by Wednesday afternoon’s post.
I had no idea that the arrangement of the sonnets would
give bother and took care to write to you to ask. The
matter was not at all important, and I shall be vexed, indeed,
if the printers are put to trouble. The printers
would, unless the snow storms interfered, get my verses
by Thursday morning’s <i>first</i> post.</p>

<p class="pbq">My theory of the sonnet is exactly expressed in the
sonnet on the sonnet. It is that, in the octave, the emotion
flows <i>out</i> in a rhythmic billow: that the solidarity of
this billow is maintained by knitting the two quatrains
together by means of two rhyme sounds only: that in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
sestet the billow <i>ebbs</i> back to “Life’s tumultuous sea”
and that like the ebb of an ocean-billow it moves backward,
not solidly, but <i>broken up</i> into wavelets. This is
only the arrangement of the rhymes in the sestet, that
not only <i>need</i> not be based upon any given system but
that <i>should</i> not be based on any given system, and should
be perceived entirely by emotional demands.</p>

<p class="pr6 reduct">Yours affectly,</p>
<p class="pr4 reduct"><span class="smcap">Theo. Watts</span>.</p>

<p class="p1">The fourth letter is from Oscar Wilde:</p>

<p class="pbqr p1"><span class="smcap">16 Tite St., Chelsea.</span></p>

<p class="pn"><span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,</p>

<p class="pbq">It will give me much pleasure to see the sonnets you
mention included in your selection. Of the two, I much
prefer “Libertatis Sacra Fames”&mdash;and if only one is
taken, would like to be represented by that. Indeed I
like the sonnets on p. 3 and p. 16 of my volume better
than the one written in Holy Week at Genoa. Perhaps
however this is merely because Art and Liberty seem
to me more vital and more religious than any Creed. I
send you a sonnet I wrote at the Sale of Keats’s love letters
some months ago. What do you think of it? It has
not yet been published. I wonder are you including Edgar
Allan Poe’s sonnet to Science. It is one I like very
much.</p>

<p class="pbq">I will look forward with much interest to the appearance
of your book.</p>

<p class="pr8 reduct">I remain</p>
<p class="pr6 reduct">Truly yours,</p>
<p class="pr4 reduct"><span class="smcap">Oscar Wilde</span>.</p>

<p class="pc1">ON THE SALE BY AUCTION OF KEATS’S LOVE LETTERS</p>

<p class="pph6 p1">These are the letters which Endymion wrote<br />
To one he loved in secret, and apart.<br />
And now the brawlers of the auction mart</p>
<p class="pph6">Bargain and bid for each poor blotted note.</p>
<p class="pph6">Ay! for each separate pulse of passion quote<br />
The merchant’s price: I think they love not art,<br />
Who break the crystal of a poet’s heart</p>
<p class="pph6"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>That small and sickly eyes may glare and gloat!</p>
<p class="pph6">Is it not said that many years ago,<br />
In a far Eastern town, some soldiers ran<br />
With torches through the midnight, and began</p>
<p class="pph6">To wrangle for mean raiment, and to throw<br />
Dice for the garments of a wretched man,</p>
<p class="pph6">Not knowing the God’s wonder, or his woe.</p>

<p class="pbq p1">I wish I could grave my sonnets on an ivory tablet&mdash;Quill
pens and note-paper are only good enough for bills
of lading. A sonnet should always <i>look</i> well. Don’t you
think so?</p>

<p class="pbqr">O. W.</p>

<p class="p1">The success of the volume was immediate, and a second
edition followed quickly. For it I begged that the Editor
would include some sonnets of his own. He had refused
to do so for the 1st Edition, but he now yielded to my wish
and included two, “Spring Wind” and “A Midsummer
Hour.” In later editions, however, he took them out
again and left only the two dedicatory sonnets to D. G.
Rossetti, for he considered that the Editor should not be
represented in the body of the book. The volume was
generously welcomed by contemporary writers. George
Meredith considered it the best exposition of the Sonnet
known to him; to Walter Pater the Introductory Essay
was “most pleasant and informing,” and “Your own
beautiful dedication to D. G. R. seems to me <i>perfect</i>, and
brought back, with great freshness, all I have felt, and so
sincerely, about him and his work.”</p>

<p>Robert Louis Stevenson expressed his views on the
sonnet in a letter to the Editor:</p>

<p class="pbqr p1"><span class="smcap">Skerrymore (Bournemouth).</span></p>

<p class="pn"><span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,</p>

<p class="pbq">Having at last taken an opportunity to read your pleasant
volume, it has had an effect upon me much to be regretted
and you will find the consequences in verse. I
had not written a serious sonnet since boyhood, when I
used to imitate Milton and Wordsworth with surprising
results: and since I have fallen again by your procuring
(a procuration) you must suffer along with me.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span></p>

<p class="pbq">May I say that my favourite sonnet in the whole range
of your book is Tennyson Turner’s “The Buoy-Bell?”
Possibly there is a touch of association in this preference;
but I think not. No human work is perfect; but
that is near enough.</p>

<p class="pr8 reduct">Yours truly,</p>
<p class="pr4 reduct"><span class="smcap">Robert Louis Stevenson</span>.</p>

<p class="p1">The form of my so-called sonnets will cause you as
much agony as it causes me little. I am base enough to
think the main point of a sonnet is the disjunction of
thought coinciding with the end of the octave: and when
a lesser disjunction makes the quatrains and sestets I call
it an ideal sonnet; even if it were rhymed anyhow. But
the cross rhyme, tears&mdash;fear, in the second is, even in
my base eyes, a vile flaw.</p>

<p>(Two sonnets were enclosed in the letter.)</p>

<p class="pc1">THE ARABESQUE<br />
(Complaint of an artist)</p>

<p class="pph6 p1">I made a fresco on the coronal,<br />
Amid the sounding silence and the void</p>
<p class="pph6">Of life’s wind-swept and unfrequented ball.<br />
I drew the nothings that my soul enjoyed;</p>
<p class="pph6">The pretty image of the enormous fact<br />
I fled; and when the sun soared over all</p>
<p class="pph6">And threw a brightness on the painted tract.<br />
Lo, the vain lines were reading on the wall!</p>
<p class="pph6">In vain we blink; our life about us lies<br />
O’erscrawled with crooked mist; we toil in vain</p>
<p class="pph6">To hear the hymn of ancient harmonies<br />
That quire upon the mountains as the plain;</p>
<p class="pph6">And from the august silence of the skies<br />
Babble of speech returns to us again.</p>

<p class="pc1">THE TOUCH OF LIFE</p>

<p class="pph6 p1">I saw a circle in a garden sit<br />
Of dainty dames and solemn cavaliers,</p>
<p class="pph6">Whereof some shuddered at the burrowing nit,<br />
And at the carrion worm some burst in tears;</p>
<p class="pph6">And all, as envying the abhorred estate<br />
Of empty shades and disembodied elves,</p>
<p class="pph6">Under the laughing stars, early and late,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>Sat shamefast at this birth and at themselves.</p>
<p class="pph6">The keeper of the house of life is fear:<br />
In the rent lion is the honey found</p>
<p class="pph6">By him that rent it; out of stony ground<br />
The toiler, in the morning of the year,</p>
<p class="pph6">Beholds the harvest of his grief abound<br />
And the green corn put forth the tender ear.</p>

<p class="p1">William Sharp offered to include “The Touch of Life”
in the body of the book, and “The Arabesque” in the
Notes. He received this reply:</p>


<p class="pn1"><span class="smcap">Dear Mr. Sharp</span>,</p>

<div class="pbq">
<p>It is very good of you, and I should like to be in one
of your pleasant and just notes; but the impulse was
one of pure imitation and is not like to return, or if it
did, to be much blessed. I have done so many things,
and cultivated so many fields in literature, that I think
I shall let the “scanty plot” lie fallow. I forgot to say
how much taken I was with Beaconsfield’s lines (scarce
a sonnet indeed) on Wellington. I am engaged with the
Duke, and I believe I shall use them.</p>

<p>I think the “Touch of Life” is the best of my snapshots;
but the other was the best idea. The fun of the
sonnet to me is to find a subject; the workmanship rebuts
me.</p>

<p>Thank you for your kind expressions, and believe me,</p></div>

<p class="pr8 reduct">Yours truly,</p>
<p class="pr4 reduct"><span class="smcap">Robert Louis Stevenson</span>.</p>

<p class="p1">The Editor was much gratified by an appreciative letter
from John Addington Symonds concerning the <i>Edition
de Luxe</i> of his Anthology:</p>


<p class="pbqr p1"><span class="smcap">Davos Platz</span>, Nov. 28, 1886.</p>

<p class="pn"><span class="smcap">My dear Sharp</span>,</p>

<div class="pbq">
<p>I have just received my copy of the magnificent edition
of your <i>Sonnets of this Century</i> to which I subscribed.
It is indeed a noble book. Let me say at once how much I
think you have improved the Preface. There are one
or two things affecting my own share in the Collection
to which I should like to call your attention.</p>

<p>I notice that in pp. xxvii-xxix of your Introduction
you have adopted the ideas I put forth (Academy, Feb.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
13, 1886) about the origin of the Sonnet. But you somewhat
confuse the argument by using the word <i>Stornello</i>.
If you look at Ancora’s <i>Poesia Popolare Italiana</i> (Livano,
Vigo), pp. 175, 313, you will see that Italians regard the
stornello (320) as a totally different species from the
rispetto. I have explained the matter in my Renaissance
in Italy, Vol. A. p. 264. I admit that there may be differences
of opinion about these popular species of verse.
Yet I have no doubt that every one in Italy, a <i>Stornello</i>
being mentioned, would think at once of a single couplet
prefaced with <i>Fiore di granata</i> or something of that
sort. However, it would be pedantic to insist upon
this point. I only do so because I believe I was the first
to indicate the probable evolution of the sonnet from the
same germ as the Rispetto Sesta Rima, and Ottava Rima;
and I am distinctly myself of opinion that the Stornello
is quite a separate offshoot.</p>

<p>I doubt whether Sonnets in Dialogue be so rare as you
imply on p. 43. I know that I composed one for Lady
Kitty Clive in 1875. It is printed on p. 117 of my <i>Vagabunduli
Libellus</i>. I do not esteem it, however, and only
published it because it was in dialogue....</p>

<p class="pr6">Believe me very truly yours,</p>
<p class="pr4"><span class="smcap">J. A. Symonds</span>.</p>

<p>P. S.&mdash;Pater is an old acquaintance of mine. Watts I
never met, and I should greatly value the opportunity of
knowing him in the flesh&mdash;in the spirit, I need hardly say,
he has long been known to me.</p></div>

<p class="p2">This postscript reminds me of the fact that Mr. Pater,
Mr. Alfred Austin, and Mr. Theodore Watts-Dunton met
together one evening at our house. I especially remember
the occasion because of an incident that occurred,
which indicated to us a temperamental characteristic of
Walter Pater. During dinner a guest asked to see a necklace
I was wearing. It was in the form of a serpent made
of silver wire deftly interwoven to resemble scales and to
make it sinuous and supple. I unfastened the serpent
and as I handed it to Mr. Pater who was nearest me, it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
writhed in a lifelike manner, and he drew back his hands
with a slight movement of dislike. In a flash I remembered
the passage in <i>Marius the Epicurean</i> in which the
hero’s dislike to serpents is so vividly described, and I
realised the description to be autobiographic. Later I had
occasion to note the same effect. My husband and I in the
early summer went down to Oxford so that I might meet
the Misses Pater at their brother’s house. In the morning
I had seen Mr. Pater’s study at Brasenose, and was
as charmed with the beauty and austerity of the decoration,
as with the sense of quiet and repose. In the
afternoon it was proposed that I should be shown the
Ifley Woods. My husband, always glad to handle the
oars, had, however, to consent to being rowed by one of
the boat attendants, for Mr. Pater with the timidity of a
recluse declined to trust himself to the unknown capabilities
of one whom he regarded rather as a townsman.
As Mr. Pater and I strolled through the wood I suddenly
noticed that my companion gave a little start and directed
my attention to what seemed of small interest. When,
however, we rejoined our companions Miss Pater asked
her brother if he had seen the dead adder lying on one
side of the path. “Oh, yes,” he answered, turning his
head on one side with a gesture of aversion; “but I did
not wish Mrs. Sharp to see it.”</p>

<p>If <i>The Sonnets of this Century</i> gained us pleasant
friendships it also brought upon us a heavy penalty. For,
within the next year or two we were inundated with letters
and appeals from budding poets, from ambitious and
wholly ignorant would-be sonneteers, who sent sheafs of
sonnets not only for criticism and advice but now and
again with the request to find a publisher for them! A
large packet arrived one day, I remember, with a letter
from an unknown in South Africa. The writer explained
his poetical ambitions, and stated that he forwarded
for consideration a hundred sonnets. On examining the
packet we found one hundred poems varying in length
from twelve to twenty lines, but not a solitary sonnet
among them!</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER VII</h2>

<p class="pch">THE SPORT OF CHANCE</p>

<p class="pc"><i>Shelley</i></p>

<p class="p2">In the summer of 1885 we went to Scotland and looked
forward to an idyllic month on West Loch Tarbert.
While staying with Mr. Pater in Oxford my husband had
seen the advertisement of a desirable cottage to be let
furnished, with service, and garden stocked with vegetables.
He knew the neighbourhood to be lovely, the attraction
was great, so we took the cottage for August,
and in due time carried our various MSS. and work to
the idyllic spot. Beautiful the surroundings were indeed:&mdash;An
upland moor sloping to the loch, with its opposite
hilly shore thickly wooded. The cottage was simplicity
itself in its appointments, but&mdash;the garden was merely a
bit of railed-in grass field destitute of plants; the vegetables
consisted of a sack of winter potatoes quite uneatable,
and the only service that the old woman owner
would give was to light the fires and wash up the dishes
and black our boots. Everything else devolved on me,
for help I could get nowhere and though my husband’s intentions
and efforts in that direction were admirable,
their practical qualities ended there! Yet to all the
drawbacks we found compensation in the loveliness of the
moorland, the peace of the solitude, and in the magnificent
sunsets. One sunset I remember specially. We had gone
for a wander westward. The sun was setting behind the
brown horizon-line of the moor, and the sky was aflame
with its glow. Suddenly we heard the sound of the pipes,
sighing a Lament. We stopped to listen. The sound came
nearer, and we saw walking over the brow of the upland
an old man with bag-pipes and streamers outlined against
the orange sky. We drew aside into a little hollow. As
he neared we saw he was gray haired, his bonnet and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
clothes were old and weatherworn. But in his face was
a rapt expression as he played to himself and tramped
across the moor, out of the sunset toward the fishing village
that lay yonder in the cold evening light.</p>

<p>The summer was a wet one, and shortly after our return
to town the poet developed disquieting rheumatic
symptoms. Nevertheless we were both hard at work
with the reviewing of pictures and books, and among
other things he was projecting a monograph on Shelley.
It was about this time I think that he decided to compete
for a prize of £100 offered by the Editor of <i>The People’s
Friend</i> for a novel suited to the requirements of that
weekly, and these requirements of course dictated the
sensational style of story. It was my husband’s one attempt
to write a novel in three volumes. He did not gain
the prize but the story ran serially through <i>The People’s
Friend</i>, and was afterward published in 1887 by Messrs.
Hurst and Blackett. The scene is laid in Scotland and in
Australia, with a Prologue dealing with Cornwall, where
he had once spent a few days in order to act as best man
to one of his fellow-passengers on the sailing ship that
brought him back from Australia.</p>

<p>The following Review from <i>The Morning Post</i> and
letter from our poet-friend Mathilde Blind will give an
idea of the style and defects of the novel:</p>

<p class="p2">“The many who have the mental courage to allow that
they prefer the objective to the subjective novel may pass
some delightful hours in the perusal of Mr. Sharp’s ‘The
Sport of Chance.’ It has <i>primâ facie</i> an undeniable advantage
to start with, i. e. it is unlike almost anything
hitherto written in the shape of a novel in three volumes.
Slightly old-fashioned, the author’s manner is
simple and earnest, while he shows much skill in unravelling
the tangled skein of a complicated plot. He deals
also in sensationalism, but this is of a peculiar kind, and
it rarely violates the canons of probability. To southerners
his highly-coloured pictures of Highland peasant
life, with their accompaniments of visions and second<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
sight, may savour of exaggeration, but not so to those
whose youth has been past amidst similar surroundings.
Many episodes of the shipwrecks of ‘The Fair Hope’ and
‘The Australasian,’ are as effective as the best of those
written by authors who make a specialty of ‘Tales of the
Sea.’ Hew Armitage’s ‘quest,’ in Australia, is related
with graphic force. The descriptions of the natural features
of the country, of life in the bush, and at the outlying
settlements, are all stamped with the vivid fidelity
that is one of the great merits of the book. Charles
Lamb, <i>alias</i> Cameron, is a singular conception. Too consistently
wicked, perhaps, to escape the reproach of being
a melo-dramatic villain, his misdeeds largely contribute
to the interest of this exciting novel.”</p>

<p class="pbqr p1">Nov. 6, 1888.</p>

<p class="pn"><span class="smcap">Dear William</span>,</p>

<p class="pbq">... Your “Sport of Chance” has helped me to while
away the hours and certainly you have crammed sensation
enough into your three volumes to furnish forth a
round dozen or so. The opening part seemed to me very
good, especially the description of the storm off the
Cornish coast, and the mystery which gradually overclouds
Mona’s life, but her death and the advent of a new
set of characters seems to me to cut the story in two,
while the sensational incidents are piled on like Ossa on
Olympus. What seemed best to me, and also most enjoyable
to my taste at least, are the personal reminiscences
which I recognised in the voyage out to Australia
and the descriptions of its scenery, full of life and freshness.
Most of all I liked the weird picture of the phosphorescent
sea with its haunting spectral shapes. You
have probably seen something of the kind and ought to
have turned it into a poem; if there had been a description
of some scene like it in your last volume I should
doubtless remember it.</p>

<p class="p1">The opening of the new year 1886&mdash;from which we
hoped much&mdash;was unpropitious. A wet winter and long
hours of work told heavily on my husband, whose ill-health
was increased by the enforced silence of his “second
self” for whose expression leisure was a necessary
condition. In a mood of dejection induced by these untoward
circumstances he sent the following birthday
greeting to his friend Eric S. Robertson:</p>

<p class="pbqr p1"><span class="smcap">46 Talgarth Road, W.</span></p>

<p class="pn"><span class="smcap">My Dear Friend</span>,</p>

<div class="pbq">
<p>I join with Lillie in love and earnest good wishes for
you as man and writer. Accept the accompanying two
sonnets as a birthday welcome.</p>

<p>There are two “William Sharp’s”&mdash;one of them unhappy
and bitter enough at heart, God knows&mdash;though he
seldom shows it. This other poor devil also sends you a
greeting of his own kind. Tear it up and forget it, if
you will.</p>

<p>But sometimes I am very tired&mdash;very tired.</p></div>

<p class="pch">I</p>

<p class="pph6">Already in the purple-tinted woods<br />
The loud-voiced throstle calls&mdash;sweet echoings<br />
Down leafless aisles that dream of bygone springs:</p>
<p class="pph6">Already towards their northern solitudes</p>
<p class="pph6">The fieldfares turn, and soaring high, wheel broods<br />

<p class="pch">II</p>

<p class="pph6">A little thing it is indeed to die:<br />
God’s seal to sanctify the soul’s advance&mdash;<br />
Or silence, and a long enfevered trance.</p>
<p class="pph6">But no slight thing is it&mdash;ere the last sigh</p>
<p class="pph6">Leaves the tired heart, ere calm and passively<br />
The worn face reverent grows, fades the dim glance&mdash;<br />
To pass away and pay no recompense</p>
<p class="pph6">To Life, who hath given to us so gloriously.</p>

<p class="pph6 p1">Not so for thee&mdash;within whose heart lie deep<br />
As ingots ‘neath the waves, thoughts true and fair.<br />
Nor ever let thy soul the burden bear,</p>
<p class="pph6">Of having life to live yet choosing sleep:<br />
Yea even if thine the dark and slippery stair,</p>
<p class="pph6">Better to toil and climb than wormlike creep.</p>

<p class="p1">In the early spring my husband was laid low with scarlet
fever and phlebitis. Recovery was slow, and at the
press view of the Royal Academy he caught a severe chill;
the next day he was in the grip of a prolonged attack
of rheumatic fever. For many days his life hung in the
balance.</p>

<p>During much of the suffering and tedium of those long
weeks the sick man passed in a dream-world of his own;
for he had the power at times of getting out of or beyond
his normal consciousness at will. At first he imagined
himself the owner of a gipsy travelling-van, in which he
wandered over the to him well-known and much-loved
solitudes of Argyll, resting where the whim dictated and
visiting his many fisher and shepherd friends. Later,
during the long crises of the illness, though unconscious
often of all material surroundings, he passed through
other keen inner phases of consciousness, through psychic
and dream experiences that afterward to some extent
were woven into the Fiona Macleod writings, and, as he
believed, were among the original shaping influences that
produced them. For a time he felt himself to be practically
dead to the material world, and acutely alive “on
the other side of things” in the greater freer universe.
He had no desire to return, and rejoiced in his freedom
and greater powers; but, as he described it afterward, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
hand suddenly restrained him: “Not yet, you must return.”
And he believed he had been “freshly sensitised”
as he expressed it; and knew he had&mdash;as I had
always believed&mdash;some special work to do before he could
again go free.</p>

<p>The illusion of his wanderings with the travelling van
was greatly helped by the thoughtfulness of his new
friend Ernest Rhys who brought him branches of trees
in early leaf from the country. These I placed upright
in the open window; and the fluttering leaves not only
helped his imagination but also awoke “that dazzle in
the brain,” as he always described the process which
led him over the borderland of the physical into the
“gardens” of psychic consciousness or, as he called it,
“into the Green Life.”</p>

<p>At the end of ten weeks he left his bed. As soon as
possible I took him to Northbrook, Micheldever, the
country house of our kind friends Mr. and Mrs. Henryson
Caird, who put it at our disposal for six weeks.
Slowly his strength came back in these warm summer
days, as he lay contentedly in the sunshine. But as he
began to exert himself new disquieting symptoms developed.
His heart proved to be badly affected and his
recovery was proportionately retarded.</p>

<p>The Autumn found us face to face with problems hard
to solve, how to meet not only current expenses but also
serious debt, with a limited stock of precarious strength.
At the moment of blackest outlook the invalid received
a generous friendly letter from Mr. Alfred Austin enclosing
a substantial cheque. The terms in which it was
offered were as kindly sympathetic as the thought which
prompted them. He had, he said, once been helped in
a similar way with the injunction to repay the loan not
to the donor but to some one else who stood in need.
Therefore he now offered it with the same conditions
attached. During the long months of illness it had been
a constant source of regret to us that we were unable to
see Philip Marston or to read to him as was our habit.
We were anxious, too, for in the autumn he had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
prostrated by a heat stroke, followed by an epileptic
seizure. At last, on Christmas day 1886 William Sharp
went to see him and spent an hour or so with him. As
he tells in his prefatory Memoir to Marston’s “Song-tide”
(<i>Canterbury Poets</i>): “He was in bed and I was
shocked at the change&mdash;as nearly a year had elapsed
since I had seen him I found the alteration only too
evident.... Throughout the winter his letters had been
full of foreboding: ‘You will miss me, perhaps, when I
am gone, but you need not mourn for me. I think few
lives have been so deeply sad as mine, though I do not
forget those who have blessed it.’”</p>

<p>This was the keynote to each infinitely sad letter.</p>

<p>“On the last day of January 1887 paralysis set in, and
for fourteen days, he lay speechless as well as sightless,
but at last he was asleep and at peace. Looking at his
serene face on the day ere the coffin lid enclosed it, where
something lovelier than mortal sleep subtly dwelt, there
was one at least of his friends who forgot all sorrow in a
great gladness for the blind poet&mdash;now no longer blind,
if he be not overwhelmed in a sleep beyond our ken.
At such a moment the infinite satisfaction of Death seems
beautiful largess for the turmoil of a few ‘dark disastrous
years.’”</p>

<p>The Spring of 1887 brought a more kindly condition
of circumstances to us, in the form of good steady work.
Mr. Eric Robertson had then been selected to fill the
vacant chair of Literature and Logic at the University
of Lahore, and, on accepting, he suggested to Mr. Joseph
Henderson that William Sharp should be his successor
as Editor of the “Literary Chair” in <i>The Young Folk’s
Paper</i>&mdash;the boys’ weekly paper for which Robert Louis
Stevenson had written his “Treasure Island.” “The
Literary Olympic” was a portion of the paper devoted to
the efforts in prose and verse of the Young Folk who
wished to exercise their budding literary talents. Their
papers were examined, criticised; a few of the most meritorious
were printed, prefaced by an article of criticism
and instruction written by their Editor and critic. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
work itself was congenial; and the interest was heightened
by the fact that it put us into touch with the youth
of all classes, in England, Scotland, and Ireland, in town
and country, alike. Several of the popular novelists and
essayists of to-day received the chief early training in
the “Olympic.” Many were the confidential personal
letters to the unknown editor, who was imagined by one
or two young aspirants to be white-haired and venerable.
This work, moreover, could be done at home, by us
both; and it brought a reliable income, a condition of
security hitherto unknown to us, which proved an excellent
tonic to the delicate Editor.</p>

<p>In August a letter came from Mr. Theodore Watts-Dunton
suggesting the possibility that an original poem,
<i>The Ode to Mother Carey’s Chicken</i> contributed to my
little anthology <i>Sea-Music</i>, should be re-printed in <i>The
Young Folk’s Paper</i>:</p>

<div class="pbq">
<p class="p1">“I do especially want it to be read by boys,” he wrote,
“who would understand and appreciate it thoroughly.”
The poem appeared; and drew forth an appreciative letter
from a young blacksmith who had sent contributions
to “The Literary Olympic.” Mr. Watts-Dunton’s acknowledgment
to the “Editor” was thus expressed:</p>

<p class="p1">“I have seen the poem in the paper and am much
gratified to be enabled to speak, thus, to thousands of
the boys of Great Britain, the finest&mdash;by far the finest&mdash;boys
in the world as I always think. It was a friendly
act on your part and the preliminary remarks are most
kind and touching.</p>

<p>“I sincerely hope that your indisposition has, by this
time, left you, and shall be glad to get a line to say that
it has. The young man’s letter is most interesting. What
pleases me most is the manly pride he takes in his business.
A blacksmith is almost the only artisan whose occupation
is tinged with the older romance as Gabriel<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> often
used to say. I love still to watch them at the forge&mdash;the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
sparks flying round them. I hope he may not forsake
such a calling for the literary struggle.”</p></div>

<p class="p2">In the early part of the year “The Sport of Chance”
had run serially through <i>The People’s Friend</i>. Its success
incited the author to write a sensational boys’ story
for <i>The Young Folk’s Paper</i>; and accordingly in the
Xmas number of that weekly appeared the first installment
of “Under the Banner of St. James,” a tale of the
conquest of Peru. This story was followed at intervals
by others such as “The Secret of the Seven Fountains,”
“Jack Noel’s Legacy,” “The Red Riders.” Although
the weaving of these sensational plots was a great enjoyment
to the writer of them, he at no time regarded them
as other than useful pot-boilers.</p>

<p>A letter written about this time to the American poet
E. C. Stedman led to a life-long friendship with him of
so genial a nature that, on becoming personally acquainted
in New York two years later, the older poet
laughingly declared that he adopted the younger man
from across the seas as his “English son.”</p>

<p>In an article on “British Song” in <i>The Victorian
Poets</i>, the Scottish poet was referred to as a Colonial.
He wrote to the author to point out the mistake “since
you are so kindly going to do me the honour of mention
in your forthcoming supplementary work, I should not
like to be misrepresented.”</p>

<p>In replying Mr. Stedman explained that no great harm
has been done:</p>


<p class="pbq p1">Something in your work made me suspect that, despite
your Australian tone, etc., you did not hail (as we
Yankees say) from the Colonies. So you will find in my
new vol. of <i>Victorian Poets</i> that I do not place you with
the Colonial poets, but just preceding them, and I have
a reference to your Rosetti volume. The limited space
afforded by my supplementary chapter has made my
references to the new men altogether too brief and inadequate.
Of this I am seriously aware, but trust that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
you and others will take into consideration the scope and
aim of the chapter. You see I have learned that “The
Human Inheritance” is scarce! Of course I shall value
greatly a copy from the author’s hands. And I count
among the two pleasant things connected with my prose
work&mdash;my earlier and natural metier being that of a poet&mdash;such
letters as yours, which put me into agreeable relations
with distant comrades-in-arms.</p>

<p class="pbq">Beginning, as you have, with the opening of a new
literary period, and with what you have already done, I
am sure you have a fine career before you&mdash;that will
extend long after your American Reviewer has ceased to
watch and profit by its course.</p>

<p class="pr6 reduct">Very sincerely yours,</p>
<p class="pr4 reduct"><span class="smcap">Edmund C. Stedman</span>.</p>

<p class="p1">A few months later Mr. Stedman wrote again:</p>

<p class="pbqr p1"><span class="smcap">New York</span>, March 27, 1888.</p>

<p class="pn"><span class="smcap">My dear Sharp</span>,</p>

<p class="pbq">Let me thank you heartily, if somewhat tardily, for
your very handsome and magnanimous review of the
<i>Victorian Poets</i>. It breathes the spirit of fairness&mdash;and
even generosity&mdash;throughout. You have been more than
“a little blind” to my faults, and to my virtues most
open-eyed and “very kind” indeed. I am sufficiently
sure of my own <i>purpose</i> to believe that you <i>have</i> ground
for perceiving that the spirit of my major criticisms is
<i>essential</i>, rather than merely “technical.” I look more to
the breadth and imagination of the poet than to minute
details&mdash;though a stickler for natural melody and the
lasting canons of art. The real value of the book lies, of
course, in the chapters on some of the elder poets. You
are quite right in pointing out the impossibility of correct
proportion in the details of the last chapter. It is
added to give more completeness to the work as a whole.
For the same reason, the earlier chapters on “The General
Choir” were originally introduced; but in them I
knew my ground better, and could point out with more
assurance the tendencies of the various “groups.” But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
I write merely to say that I am heartily satisfied with
your criticism, and grateful for it; and that I often read
your other reviews with advantage&mdash;and shall watch your
career, already so fruitful, with great interest. A man
who comes down to first principles and looks at things
broadly, as you are doing, is sure in the end to be a man
of mark.</p>

<p class="pr6 reduct">Very faithfully yours,</p>
<p class="pr4 reduct"><span class="smcap">Edmund C. Stedman</span>.</p>

<p class="p2">One desirable result of this good fortune was a change
of residence to a higher part of the town, where the air
was purer, and access to green fields easier. To this end
in the Spring of 1887 we took a little house for three
years in Goldhurst Terrace, South Hampstead. As it
was numbered 17<i>a</i>, much annoyance was caused as our
letters frequently were delivered at No. 17. A name therefore
had to be found, and we dubbed our new home <i>Wescam</i>,
a name made up of the initials of my husband, myself
and our friend Mrs. Caird whose town house was
within two minutes’ walk of us. There was a sunny study
for the invalid on the ground floor, to obviate as much
as possible the need of going up and down stairs. The
immediate improvement in his health from the higher
air and new conditions was so marked that we had every
reason to hope it would before many months be practically
re-established.</p>

<p>The most important undertaking after the long illness
was the monograph on Shelley written for <i>Great Writers’
Series</i> (Walter Scott) and published in the autumn
of 1887. It was a work of love, for Shelley had been
the inspiring genius of his youth, the chief influence in
his verse till he knew Rossetti. He was in sympathy with
much of Shelley’s thought: with his hatred of rigid conventionality,
of the tyranny of social laws; with his antagonism
to existing marriage and divorce laws, with his
belief in the sanctity of passion when called forth by high
and true emotion. He exclaimed that</p>

<p>“It is my main endeavour in this short life of Shelley<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
to avoid all misstatement and exaggeration; to give as
real a narrative of his life from the most reliable sources
as lies within my power; to recount without detailed criticism
and as simply and concisely as practicable, the record
of his poetic achievements. To this end I shall chiefly
rely on anecdote and explanatory detail, or poems and
passages noteworthy for their autobiographical or idiosyncratic
value, and on indisputable facts.”</p>

<p>He proposed merely to give a condensation of all really
important material; and based his monograph mainly
on Professor Dowden’s memorable work (then recently
published). Many statements written by William Sharp
about Shelley may be quoted as autobiographic of himself.
For instance: “From early childhood he was a
mentally restless child. Trifles unnoticed by most children
seem to have made keen and permanent impression
on him&mdash;the sound of wind, the leafy whisper of trees,
running water. The imaginative faculties came so early
into play, that the unconscious desire to create resulted
in the invention of weird tales sometimes based on remote
fact in the experience of more or less weird hallucinations.”</p>

<p>Or again: “The fire of his mind for ever consuming his
excitable body, his swift and ardent emotions, his over
keen susceptibilities all combined to increase the frailty
of his physical health.” Or this in particular: “He did
not outgrow his tendency to invest every new and sympathetic
correspondent (and I would add, friend) with
lives of ideal splendour.”</p>

<p>And in explanation of each idealization appearing to
him “as the type of that ideal Beauty which had haunted
his imagination from early boyhood,” he adds: “No fellow
mortal could have satisfied the desire of his heart.
Perhaps this almost fantastic yearning for the unattainable&mdash;this
desire of the moth for the star&mdash;is the heritage
of many of us. It is a longing that shall be insatiable
even in death.” With Shelley he might have said of himself:
“I think one is always in love with something or
other; the error&mdash;and I confess it is not easy for spirits<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
cased in flesh and blood to avoid it&mdash;consists in seeking
in a mortal image the likeness of what is, perhaps, eternal.”</p>

<p>From the many letters the biographer received after
the publication of his book I select three:</p>


<p class="pbqr p1"><span class="smcap">Brasenose College</span>, Nov. 23d.</p>

<p class="pn"><span class="smcap">My dear Sharp</span>,</p>

<p class="pbq">I am reading your short life of Shelley with great
pleasure and profit. Many thanks for your kindness in
sending it. It seems to me that with a full, nay! an enthusiastic,
appreciation of Shelley and his work, you unite
a shrewdness and good sense rare in those who have
treated this subject. And then your book is pleasant
and effective, in contrast to a French book on Shelley
of which I read reluctantly a good deal lately. Your book
leaves a very definite image on the brain.</p>

<p>I wonder how it is with you now, whether you are better,
which I sincerely hope, and already in the Isle of
Wight? but I suppose you will only go after Christmas.
To-day it is so cold here that I wonder what it must be
like with you; there is snow on the mountains behind the
house and the sea looks iron-gray and ungenial.</p>

<p>I never told you I think how much I liked your “Shelley,”
which I think gives a very succinct and fair statement
of the poet’s life and works. It is just what is
wanted by the public at large, and I thought your remarks
on Shelley’s relations with Harriet exceedingly sympathetic
and to the point; as well as what you say touching
his married life with Mary; the passage on page 98 concerning
this disenchantment with all mortal passion
struck me as most happily felt and expressed. I have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
only one fault to find with you, and that you will think
a very selfish one (so you must excuse it), to wit that
when speaking of <i>The Revolt of Islam</i> you did not mention
in a line or so that I was the first writer who pointed
out, first in the “Westminster Review” and afterward
in my Memoir of the poet, that in Cythna Shelley had introduced
a new type of Woman into poetry. I am rather
proud of it, and as it was mentioned by several of Shelley’s
subsequent biographers I would have been pleased
to have seen it in a volume likely to be so popular as
yours.</p>

<p>But enough of this small matter.</p>

<p>I wish you and your dear wife health and happiness.</p></div>

<p class="pn"><span class="smcap">Dear Mr. Sharp</span>,</p>

<p class="pbq">I have read your book on Shelley, and prefer it,
matched with the bulky. Putting out of view Matthew
Arnold’s very lofty lift of superterrestrial nose over the
Godwin nest, one inclines to agree with him about our
mortal business of Shelley. We shall be coming next
to medical testimony, with expositions. You have said
just enough, and in the right tones. Yesterday a detachment
of the Sunday tramps under Leslie Stephen
squeezed at the table in the small dining-room you know,
after a splendid walk over chalk and sand. When you
are in the mood to make one of us, give me note of warning,
and add to the pleasure by persuading your wife to
come with you.</p>

<p class="pbq">And tell her that this invitation would be more courtly
were I addressing her directly.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER VIII</h2>

<p class="pch">ROMANTIC BALLADS</p>

<p class="pc"><i>The Children of To-morrow</i></p>


<p class="p2">The three years spent at Wescam were happy years,
full of work and interest. Slowly but steadily as health
was re-established, the command over work increased,
and all work was planned with the hope that before very
long William should be able to devote himself to the form
of imaginative work that he knew was germinating in his
mind. Meanwhile he had much in hand. Critical work
for many of the weeklies, a volume of poems in preparation,
and a monograph on Heine, were the immediate preoccupations.</p>

<p><i>Romantic Ballads and Poems of Phantasy</i> was published
in the spring (Walter Scott). The poems had been
written at different times during the previous five or six
years. “The Son of Allan” had met with the approval
of Rossetti, whose influence was commented upon by certain
of the critics. The book was well received both in
England and America. <i>The Boston Literary World</i> considered
that in such poems as “The Isle of Lost Dreams,”
“Twin Souls,” and “The Death Child” “a conjuring
imagination rises to extraordinary beauty of conception.”
These three poems are undoubtedly forerunners of the
work of the “Fiona Macleod” period. In the Preface the
writer stated his conviction that “a Romantic Revival is
imminent in our poetic literature, a true awakening of
genuinely romantic sentiment. The most recent phase
thereof,” however, “that mainly due to Rossetti, has not
fulfilled the hopes of those who saw in it the prelude
to a new great poetic period. It has been too literary,
inherently, but more particularly in expression.... Spontaneity
it has lacked supremely.... It would seem as if
it had already become mythical that the supreme merit of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
a poem is not perfection of art, but the quality of the
imagination which is the source of such real or approximate
perfection.... In a sense, there is neither Youth
nor Age in Romance, it is the quintessence of the most
vivid emotions of life.” And further on he voices the
very personal belief “Happy is he who, in this day of
spiritual paralysis, can still shut his eyes for a while and
dream.”</p>

<p>Concerning the idea of fatality that underlies the opening
ballad “The Weird of Michel Scott”&mdash;“meant as a
lyrical tragedy, a tragedy of a soul that finds the face of
disastrous fate set against it whithersoever it turn in the
closing moments of mortal life,” he wrote to a friend,
“What has always impressed me deeply&mdash;how deeply I
can scarcely say&mdash;is the blind despotism of fate. It is
manifested in Æschylus, in Isaiah and in the old Hebrew
Prophets, in all literature, in all history and in life. This
blind, terrible, indifferent Fate, this tyrant Chance, stays
or spares, mutilates or rewards, annihilates or passes by
without heed, without thought, with absolute blankness
of purpose, aim, or passion....</p>

<p>“I am tortured by the passionate desire to create
beauty, to sing something of ‘the impossible songs’ I
have heard, to utter something of the rhythm of life that
has most touched me. The next volume of romantic
poems will be daringly of the moment, vital with the life
and passion of to-day (I speak hopefully, not with arrogant
assurance, of course), yet not a whit less romantic
than ‘The Weird of Michel Scott’ or ‘The Death Child.’”</p>

<p>Many encouraging and appreciative letters reached
him from friends known and unknown.</p>

<p>In Mr. William Allingham’s opinion “Michel Scott
clothing his own Soul with Hell-fire is tremendous!”</p>

<p>Professor Edward Dowden was not wholly in accord
with the poet’s views, as expressed in the Introduction:</p>


<p class="pr5 p1 reduct"><span class="smcap">Rathmines, Dublin</span>,</p>
<p class="pr4 reduct">July 10, 1888.</p>

<p class="pn"><span class="smcap">My dear Sharp</span>,</p>

<p class="pbq">It gave me great pleasure to get your new volume from
yourself. I think that a special gift of yours, and one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
not often possessed, appears in this volume of romance
and phantasy. I don’t find it possible to particularise
one poem as showing its presence more than another, for
the unity of the volume comes from its presence. And I
rejoice at anything which tends to make this last quarter
of the century other than what I feared it would be&mdash;a
period of collecting and arranging facts, with perhaps
such generalisations as specialists can make. (Not that
this is not valuable work, but if it is the sole employment
of a generation what an ill time for the imagination
and the emotions!) At the same time I don’t think I should
make any <i>demand</i>, if I could, for Romance. I should not
put forth any manifesto in its favour, for this reason&mdash;that
the leaders of a movement of phantasy and romance
will have such a sorry following. The leaders of a school
which overvalued form and technique may have been
smaller men than the leaders of a romantic school, yet
still their followers were learning something; but while
the chiefs of the romantic and phantastic movement will
be men of genius, what a lamentable crowd the disciples
will be, who will try to be phantastic <i>prepense</i>. We shall
have the horrors of the spasmodic school revived without
that element of a high, vague, spiritual intention
which gave some nobility&mdash;or pseudo-nobility&mdash;to the disciples
of the spasmodists. We shall have every kind of
extravagance and folly posing as poetry.</p>

<p class="pbq">The way to control or check this is for the men who
have a gift for romance to use that gift&mdash;which you have
done&mdash;and to prove that phantasy is not incoherence but
has its own laws. And they ought to discourage any and
every one from attempting romance who has not a genius
for romance.</p>

<p class="pr6 reduct">Sincerely yours,</p>
<p class="pr4 reduct"><span class="smcap">E. Dowden</span>.</p>

<p class="p2">Meanwhile, the author of the ballads was at work preparing
two volumes for the <i>Canterbury Series</i>&mdash;a volume
of selected Odes, and one of American Sonnets, to which
he contributed prefaces&mdash;and writing critical articles for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
the <i>Academy</i>, <i>Athenæum</i>, <i>Literary World</i>, etc. Various
important books were published that spring, and among
those which came into his hands to write about were
<i>Underwoods</i> by R. L. Stevenson, <i>In Hospital</i> by W. Henley;
and from these writers respectively he received letters
of comment. I am unable to remember what was
the occasion of the first of the R. L. Stevenson notes,
what nature of request it was that annoyed the older
writer. Neither of his letters is dated, but from the
context each obviously belongs to 1888.</p>


<p class="pn1"><span class="smcap">Dear Mr. Sharp</span>,</p>

<p class="pbq">Yes, I was annoyed with you, but let us bury that; you
have shown so much good nature under my refusal that I
have blotted out the record.</p>

<p class="pbq">And to show I have repented of my wrath: is your article
written? If not, you might like to see early sheets of
my volume of verse, not very good, but still&mdash;and the
Scotch ones would amuse you I believe. And you might
like also to see the plays I have written with Mr. Henley:
let me know, and you shall have them as soon as I can
manage.</p>

<p class="pr6 reduct">Yours very truly,</p>
<p class="pr4 reduct"><span class="smcap">Robert Louis Stevenson</span>.</p>

<p class="p1">The notice I had seen already, and was pleased with.</p>

<p class="p2">After the appearance of the review of <i>Underwoods</i>, R.
L. S. wrote again:</p>


<p class="pn1"><span class="smcap">Dear Mr. Sharp</span>,</p>

<p class="pbq">What is the townsman’s blunder?&mdash;though I deny I am
a townsman, for I have lived, on the whole, as much
or more in the country: well, perhaps not so much. Is it
that the thrush does not sing at night? That is possible.
I only know most potently the blackbird (his cousin)
does: many and many a late evening in the garden of
that poem have I listened to one that was our faithful
visitor; and the sweetest song I ever heard was past
nine at night in the early spring, from a tree near the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
N. E. gate of Warriston cemetery. That I called what
I believe to have been a merle by the softer name of mavis
(and they are all turdi, I believe) is the head and front
of my offence against literal severity, and I am curious
to hear if it has really brought me into some serious
error.</p>

<p class="pbq">Your article is very true and very kindly put: I have
never called my verses poetry: they are verse, the verse
of a speaker not a singer; but that is a fair business like
another. I am of your mind too in preferring much the
Scotch verses, and in thinking “<i>Requiem</i>” the nearest
thing to poetry that I have ever “clerkit.”</p>

<p class="pr6 reduct">Yours very truly,</p>

<p class="pn"><span class="smcap">My dear Sharp</span>,</p>

<div class="pbq">
<p>I am glad to have your letter. Of course I disagreed
with your view of <i>In Hospital</i>; but I didn’t think it all
worth writing about. I felt you’d mistaken my aim; but
I felt that your mistake (as I conceived it to be) was honestly
made, and that if the work itself had failed to produce
a right effect upon you, it was useless to attempt
to correct the impressions by means outside art.</p>

<p>Art (as I think) is treatment <i>et præteria nil</i>. What
I tried to do in <i>In Hospital</i> was to treat a certain subject&mdash;which
seems to me to have a genuine human interest
and importance&mdash;with discretion, good feeling, and a certain
dignity. If I failed, I failed as an artist. My treatment
(or my art) was not good enough for my material.
<i>Voilà.</i> I thought (I will frankly confess it) that I had
got the run of the thing&mdash;that my results were touched
with the distinction of art. You didn’t think so, and I
saw that, as far as you were concerned, I had failed of my
effort. I was sorry to have so failed, and then the matter
ended. To be perfectly frank, I objected to but one expression&mdash;“occasionally
crude”&mdash;in all the article. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
confess I don’t see the propriety of the phrase at all. My
method is, I know, the exact reverse of your own; but I
beg you to believe that my efforts&mdash;of simplicity, directness,
bluntness, brutality even&mdash;are carefully calculated,
and that “crude”&mdash;which means raw, if it means anything
at all&mdash;is a word that I’d rather not have applied
to me. The <i>Saturday</i> Reviewer made use of it, and I had
it out with him, and he owned that it was unfortunately
used&mdash;that it didn’t mean “raw,” but something un-Miltonic
(as it were), something novel and personal and
which hadn’t had time to get conventionalised. It’s
stupid and superfluous to write like this; especially as I
had meant to say nothing about it. But yours of last
night is so kind and pleasant that I think it best to write
what’s on my mind, or rather what <i>was</i> on it when I read
your article. For the rest, it is good to hear that you’re
re-reading, and are kind of dissatisfied with your own
first views. I shall look with great interest for the new
statement, and value it&mdash;whatever its conclusions&mdash;a
good deal. I have worked hard at the little book, and am
disposed (as you see) to take it more seriously than it
deserves; and whatever is said about it comes home
to me.</p>

<p class="pr4">Always yours sincerely,</p>
<p class="pr2">W. E. H.</p>

<p><i>P. S.</i>&mdash;I am glad you quoted “The King of Babylon.”
It’s my own favourite of all. I call it “a romance without
adjectives” and the phrase (which represents an ideal)
says everything. I wish I could do more of the same
reach and tune.</p></div>

<p class="p2">At Wescam we enjoyed once more the pleasant ways
of friendship that had grown about us, and especially our
Sunday informal evening gatherings to which came all
those with whom we were in sympathy. Among the most
frequent were Mrs. Mona Caird, the eager champion of
women long before the movement passed into the militant
hands of the suffragettes; Walter Pater, during his Oxford
vacation; Dr. and Mrs. Garnett; John M. Robertson,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
who was living the “simple life” of a socialist in rooms
close by; Richard Whiteing, then leader-writing for <i>The
Daily News</i>, and author of the beautiful idyll <i>The Island</i>.
Mathilde Blind&mdash;poetess novelist, who in youth had
sat an eager disciple at the feet of Mazzini, came frequently,
Ernest Rhys was writing poems and editing
<i>The Camelot Classics</i> from the heights of Hampstead,
and his wife, then Miss Grace Little, lived in the neighbourhood
with her sisters, the eldest of whom, Lizzie Little,
was a writer of charming verse. W. B. Yeats came in
the intervals of wandering over Ireland in search of Folk
tales; John Davidson had recently come to London, and
was bitter over the hard struggle he was enduring; William
Watson was a rare visitor. Another frequent visitor
was Arthur Tomson the landscape painter, who came
to us with an introduction from Mr. Andrew Lang. A
warm friendship grew up between Arthur and ourselves,
which was deepened by his second marriage with Miss
Agnes Hastings, a girl-friend of ours, and lasted till his
death in 1905. Mr. and Mrs. John M. Swan came occasionally,
Mr. and Mrs. William Strang, we saw frequently,
and Theodore Roussell was an ever welcome
guest. Sir George Douglas came now and again from
Kelso; Charles Mavor, editor of <i>The Art Review</i>, ran
down occasionally from Glasgow. Other frequenters of
our Sunday evenings were Richard Le Gallienne, whose
<i>Book bills of Narcissus</i> was then recently published;
Miss Alice Corkran, Mr. and Mrs. Todhunter, Mr. and
Mrs. Gilbert Coleridge, Mr. and Mrs. Frank Rinder, Mr.
and Mrs. Joseph Pennell. The Russian Nihilist Stepniak
and his wife were a great interest to us. I remember on
one occasion they told us that Stepniak intended to make
a secret visit to Russia&mdash;as he had done before&mdash;that he
was starting the next morning, and though every care
would be taken in matter of disguise, the risks were so
great that he and his wife always said farewell to one
another as though they never would meet again.</p>

<p>Mrs. Caird’s town house was close to us; and she,
keenly interested&mdash;as my husband and I also were&mdash;in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
the subject of the legal position of women, had that spring
written two articles on the Marriage question which were
accepted by and published in <i>The Westminster Review</i> in
July. Twelve years ago the possibilities of a general discussion
on such subjects were very different to what exist
now. The sensibilities of both men and women&mdash;especially
of those who had no adequate knowledge of the
legal inequalities of the Marriage laws nor of the abuses
which were and are in some cases still the direct outcome
of them&mdash;were disturbed and shocked by the plain
statements put forward, by the passionate plea for justice,
for freedom from tyrannous legal oppression, exercised
consciously and unconsciously. Mrs. Caird’s articles
met with acute hostility of a kind difficult to understand
now, and much misunderstanding and unmerited
abuse was meted out to her. Nevertheless these brave
articles, published in book form under the title of <i>The
Morality of Marriage</i>, and the novels written by the same
pen, have been potent in altering the attitude of the public
mind in its approach to and examination of such questions,
in making private discussion possible.</p>

<p>In the autumn of 1888 the monograph on Heine was
published in the <i>Great Writers Series</i> (Walter Scott);
and the author always regarded it as the best piece of
work of the kind he ever did. It seemed fitting that the
writer of a life of Shelley should write one of Heine, for
there is a kinship between the two poets. To their biographer
Heine was the strangest and most fascinating
of all the poets not only of one country and one century,
but of all time and of all nations; he saw in the wayward
brilliant poet “one of those flowers which bloom more
rarely than the aloe&mdash;human flowers which unfold their
petals but once, it may be, in the whole slow growth of
humanity.... At his best Heine is a creature of controlled
impulse; at his worst he is a creature of impulse
uncontrolled. Through extremes he gained the golden
mean of art: here is his <i>apologia</i>.”</p>

<p>The book is an endeavour to handle the subject in an
impartial spirit, to tell the story vividly, to give a definite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
impression of the strange personality, and in the concluding
pages to summarise Heine’s genius. But, “do what
we will we cannot affiliate, we cannot classify Heine.
When we would apprehend it his genius is as volatile as
his wit.... Of one thing only can we be sure: that he
is of our time, of our century. He is so absolutely and
essentially modern that he is often antique....</p>

<p>“As for his song-motive, I should say it was primarily
his <i>Lebenslust</i>, his delight in life: that love so intensely
human that it almost necessarily involved the ignoring
of the divine. Rainbow-hued as is his genius, he himself
was a creature of earth. It was enough to live.... He
would cling to life, even though it were by a rotten beam,
he declared once in his extremity. And the poet of life
he unquestionably is. There is a pulse in everything he
writes: his is no galvanised existence. No parlour passions
lead him into the quicksands of oblivion....”</p>

<p>The author was gratified by appreciative letters from
Dr. Richard Garnett and Mr. George Meredith:</p>


<p class="pr5 p1 reduct"><span class="smcap">3 St. Edmund’s Terrace</span>,</p>

<p class="pn"><span class="smcap">My dear Sharp</span>,</p>

<p class="pbq">I have now finished your Heine, and can congratulate
you upon an excellent piece of biographical work. You
are throughout perfectly clear and highly interesting,
and, what is more difficult with your subject, accurate and
impartial. Or, if there is any partiality it is such as it is
becoming in one poet to enlist aid for another. With all
one’s worship of Heine’s genius, it must be allowed that
he requires a great deal of toleration. The best excuse
to be made for him is that his faults were largely faults
of race&mdash;and just now I feel amiably toward the Jews,
for if you have seen the Athenæum you will have observed
that I have fallen into the hands of the Philistines.
Almost the only point in which I differ from you is as
regards your too slight mention of Platen, who seems to
me not only a master of form but a true though limited
poet&mdash;a sort of German Matthew Arnold. Your kind notice
of my translation from the Romanzen did not escape<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
me. Something, perhaps, should have been said of James
Thomson, the best English translator.</p>

<p class="pn1"><span class="smcap">Dear Mr. Sharp</span>,</p>

<p class="pbq">Your Heine gave me pleasure. I think it competently
done; and coming as a corrective to Stigund’s work, it
brings the refreshment of the antidote. When I have the
pleasure of seeing you we will converse upon Heine. Too
much of his&mdash;almost all of the Love poems drew both
tenderness and tragic emotion from a form of sensualism,
much of his wit too was wilful&mdash;a trick of the mind. Always
beware of the devilish in wit: it has the obverse
of an intellectual meaning, and it shows at the best interpretation,
a smallness of range. Macmillan says that if
they can bring out my book “Reading of Earth” on the
18th I may expect it. Otherwise you will not receive a
copy until after Christmas.</p>

<p>Mr. Meredith wrote again after the publication of his
poems:</p>


<p class="pbqr p1"><span class="smcap">Box Hill</span>, Feb. 15, 1888.</p>

<p class="pn"><span class="smcap">Dear Mr. Sharp</span>,</p>

<div class="pbq">
<p>It is not common for me to be treated in a review
with so much respect. But your competency to speak
on the art of verse gives the juster critical tone.</p>

<p>Of course you have poor J. Thomson’s book. I have
had pain in reading it. Nature needs her resources, considering
what is wasted of her finest. That is to say, on
this field&mdash;and for the moment I have eyes on the narrow
rather than the wider. It is our heart does us this mischief.
Philosophy can as little subject it as the Laws of
men can hunt Nature out of women&mdash;artificial though we
force them to be in their faces. But if I did not set<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>

<p class="pr6 reduct">Yours very cordially,</p>
<p class="pr4 reduct"><span class="smcap">George Meredith</span>.</p>

<p class="p1">It was the late spring before we could visit Mr. Meredith.
The day of our going was doubly memorable to me,
because as we went along the leafy road from Burford
Bridge station we met Mr. and Mrs. Grant Allen&mdash;my
first meeting with them&mdash;whose home was at that time
in Dorking. Memorable, too, was the courteous genial
greeting from our host and his charming daughter; and
the many delightful incidents of that first week end visit.
William and Mr. Meredith had long talks in the garden
chalet on the edge of the wood. And in the evenings the
novelist read aloud to us. On that occasion I think it was
he read some chapters from “One of our Conquerors” on
which he was working; another time it was from “The
Amazing Marriage” and from “Lord Ormont and his
Aminta.” The reader’s enjoyment seemed as great as
that of his audience, and it interested me to hear how
closely his own methods of conversation resembled, in
wittiness and brilliance, those of the characters in his
novels. Sometimes he turned a merciless play of wit on
his listener; but my husband, who was as deeply attached
to the man as he admired the writer, enjoyed these verbal
duels in which he was usually worsted. The incident of
the visit that charmed me most arose from my stating
that I had never heard the nightingale. So on the Sunday
afternoon we were taken to a stretch of woodland,
“my woods of Westermain” the poet smilingly declared,
and there, standing among the tree-boles in the late
afternoon sun-glow I listened for the bird-notes as he
described them to me until he was satisfied I heard aright.</p>

<p>The Xmas of 1888, and the following New Year’s day<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
we passed at Tunbridge Wells, with Mathilde Blind, in
rooms overlooking the common. Many delightful hours
were spent together in the evenings listening to one or
other of the two poets reading aloud their verse, or parts
of the novels they had in process. Mathilde was writing
her <i>Tarantella</i>; my husband had recently finished a boys’
serial story for <i>Young Folk’s Paper</i>, with a highly sensational
plot entitled “The Secret of Seven Fountains,”
and was at work on a Romance of a very different order
in which he then was deeply interested, though in later
life he considered it immature in thought and expression.
The boys’ story was one of adventure, of life seen from
a purely objective point of view. <i>The Children of To-morrow</i>
was the author’s first endeavour to give expression
in prose to the more subjective side of his nature, to
thoughts, feelings, aspirations he had hitherto suppressed;
it is the direct forerunner of the series of romantic
tales he afterward wrote as Fiona Macleod; it
was also the expression of his attitude of revolt against
the limitations of the accepted social system. The writing
of the Monograph on Shelley had rekindled many
ideas and beliefs he held in common with the earlier
poet&mdash;ideas concerning love and marriage, viewed not
from the standpoint of the accepted practical standard of
morality, nor of the possible realisation by the average
humanity of a more complex code of social morality,
but viewed from the standpoint held by a minority of
dreamers and thinkers who look beyond the present
strictly guarded, fettered conditions of married life, to
a time, when man and woman, equally, shall know that
to stultify or slay the spiritual inner life of another
human being, through the radical misunderstanding between
alien temperaments inevitably tied to one another,
is one of the greatest crimes against humanity. That
the author knew how visionary for the immediate future
were these ideas, which we at that time so eagerly discussed
with a little group of intimate sympathetic friends,
is shown by the prefatory lines in the book:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span></p>

<p class="pphq6 p1">“Forlorn the way, yet with strange gleams of gladness;<br />

<p class="p1"><i>The Children of To-morrow</i> called forth all manner of
divergent opinions. It was called depressing by one
critic, and out of touch with realities. Another considered
the chief interest of the book to consist “in what
may be called its aims. It is clearly an attempt toward
greater truth in art and life.” All agreed as to the power
displayed in the descriptions of nature. The critic in
<i>Public Opinion</i> showed discernment as to the author’s intentions
when he wrote “To our mind the delightful
irresponsibility of this book, the calm determination
which it displays that now, at least, the author means to
please himself, to give vent to many a pent up feeling
or opinion constitutes one of its greatest charms. This
waywardness, the waywardness of a true artist, is shown
on almost every page.... Mr. Sharp states his case
with wonderful power and lucidity; he draws no conclusions&mdash;as
an artist they do not concern him&mdash;he leaves
the decision to the individual temperament.”</p>

<p>Mathilde Blind wrote to the author:</p>


<p class="pbqr p1"><span class="smcap">1 St. Edmund’s Terrace</span>, N. W., 1889.</p>

<p class="pn"><span class="smcap">Dear Child of the Future</span>,</p>

<p class="pbq">You have indeed written a strange, weird, romantic tale
with the sound of the sea running through it like an
accompaniment. Adama Acosta is a specially well-imagined
and truthful character of a high kind; and the intermittent
wanderings of his brain have something akin to
the wailing notes of the instrument of which he is such
a master. But it is in your conception of love&mdash;the subtle,
delicate, ideal attraction of two beings inevitably drawn
to each other by the finest elements of their being&mdash;that
the charm of the story consists to my mind; on the other
hand, you have succeeded in drawing a very realistic and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
vivid picture of the hard and handsome Lydia, with her
purely negative individuality, and in showing the deadly
effect which one person may exercise over another in
married life&mdash;without positive outward wrongdoing
which might lead to the divorce court. I agree with you
in thinking that the end is the finest part of the Romance,
especially the last scene where Dane and Sanpriel are in
the wood under the old oak tree, where the voice of the
rising storm with its ominous note of destiny is magnificently
described. Such a passing away in the mid-most
fire of passion on the wings of the elements has always
seemed to me the climax of human happiness. But I fear
the book is likely to rouse a good deal of opposition in
many quarters for the daring disregard of the binding
sanctity of the marriage relation. If I may speak quite
openly and as a friend who would wish you to do yourself
full justice and produce the best work that is in you,
I wish you had given yourself more time to work out
some of the situations which seem, to me at least, to lack
a certain degree of precision and consistency. Thus, for
example, Dane after discovering that Ford has been trying
to murder him, and is making secret love to his wife,
rushes off to the painter’s studio evidently bent on some
sort of quarrel or revenge, yet nothing comes of it, and
afterwards we find the would-be murderer on outwardly
friendly terms with the sculptor on board the house boat.
I must tell you by the way how powerful I think the scene
of the dying horse in Ratho Sands and the murder of
Lydia. I should also have liked to have heard a little
more of the real aims and objects of “The Children of
the Future” and would like to know whether such an association
really exists among any section of the modern
Jews; we must talk of that this evening or some other
time when we meet. I hope to look in to-night with Sarrazin
and Bunand who are coming to a little repast here
first. Madox Brown has been reading your book with
the greatest interest.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER IX</h2>

<p class="pch">FIRST VISIT TO AMERICA</p>

<p>In the Spring of 1889 the Chair of Literature at University
College, London, became vacant on the death of
Professor Henry Morley; and many of William Sharp’s
friends urged him to stand for election. He was of two
minds on the subject. His inclinations were against
work of the kind, for, temperamentally, he had difficulty
in regulating his life in accordance with strict routine.
Born, as he would say, with the wandering wave in his
blood, the fixed and the inevitable were antipathetic to
him. He was, however, awake to the material importance
of such a post, to the advantages of a steady income.
Had he had himself only to consider he would not have
given the proposal a thought; but he believed it to be his
duty to attempt to secure the post for his wife’s sake,
though she was not of that opinion. Among the many
friends who advocated his election were Robert Browning,
George Meredith, Walter Pater, Theodore Watts
Dunton, Alfred Austin, Dr. Richard Garnett, Prof. Minto,
Hall Caine, Sir George Douglas, Aubrey De Vere, Mrs.
Augusta Webster. When, however, the date of election
drew near, he consulted his doctor and withdrew his candidature.
The question, to him, had all along been one of
security of means versus freedom of action; and having
done his duty in the matter, his relief was great that the
decision left him in possession of his freedom.</p>

<p>For some time William Sharp had contemplated a visit
to the United States, where he was well known as poet
and critic, and had many friendly correspondents. So
he considered the moment to be opportune. He decided
to go; although he was forbidden to lecture in America,
and very opportunely our friend Mrs. Caird asked me to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
accompany her to Austria&mdash;to the Sun-cure at Veldes in
the Carpathian Alps. She and I were the first to leave,
and eventually, my husband after his return from America
joined me at Cologne and accompanied me home.</p>

<p>Meanwhile he made his preparations for a visit to Canada
and New York, and just before starting paid a flying
visit to Mr. George Meredith who had written to him:</p>


<p class="pbqr p1"><span class="smcap">Box Hill</span>, July 15, 1889.</p>

<p class="pn"><span class="smcap">Dear Mr. Sharp</span>,</p>

<p class="pbq">This would have been headed to your wife, but for the
chances of her flying, and the letter after her. Tell her
we are grieved to lose the pleasure her company would
give, and trust to welcome her on her return. When she
looks on Tyrol, let her strain an eye to see my heart on
the topmost peak. We hope for your coming on Saturday.</p>

<p class="pr6 reduct">Yours very truly,</p>
<p class="pr4 reduct"><span class="smcap">George Meredith</span>.</p>

<p class="p1">He looked forward to his American tour with keen delight.
New experiences were ever alluring; he had the
power of throwing himself heart and soul into every
fresh enjoyment. Going by himself seemed to promise
chances of complete recovery of health; the unexplored
and the unknown beckoned to him with promise of excitement
and adventure.</p>

<p>As he wrote to Mr. Stedman: “I am a student of much
else besides literature. Life in all its manifestations is
of passionate interest for me, and I cannot rest from
incessant study and writing. Yet I feel that I am but on
the threshold of my literary life. I have a life-time of
ambitious schemes before me; I may perhaps live to fulfil
a tenth part of them.”</p>

<p>Mid-August found him in Canada. Fine as he considered
the approach to Nova Scotia, Newfoundland impressed
him more. At Halifax he was the guest of the
Attorney General. He wrote to me “Mr. and Mrs. Longley<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
were most kind, and so were all the many leading
people to whom I was introduced. I was taken to
the annual match of the Quoit Club, and was asked to
present the Cup to the winner at the close, with a few
words if I felt disposed. Partly from being so taken
aback, partly from pleased excitement, and partly from
despair, I lost all nervousness and made a short and
(what I find was considered) humourous speech, so slowly
and coolly spoken that I greatly admired it myself!”</p>

<p>At Halifax, which he considered “worth a dozen of the
Newfoundland capital,” he was met by Professor Charles
Roberts who had come “to intercept me so as to go off
with him for a few days in Northern Scotia and across
the Straits to Prince Edward Island. So, a few days
later Prof. Roberts and I, accompanied for the first 100
miles by Mr. Longley, started for Pictou, which we
reached after 5 hours most interesting journey. The Attorney
General has kindly asked me to go a three days’
trip with him (some 10 days hence) through the famous
Cape Breton district, with the lovely Bras D’Or lakes:
and later on he has arranged for a three days’ moose-hunt
among the forests of Southern Acadia, where we
shall camp out in tents, and be rowed by Indian guides.”</p>

<p>New Glasgow delighted him; he visited Windsor and
Halifax: “I went with Charles Roberts and Bliss Carman
through Evangeline’s country. En route I travelled on
the engine of the train and enjoyed the experience. Grand
Pré delighted me immensely&mdash;vast meadows, with lumbering
wains and the simple old Acadian life. The
orchards were in their glory&mdash;and the apples delicious!
At one farm house we put up, how you would have enjoyed
our lunch of sweet milk hot cakes, great bowls of
huckleberries and cream, tea, apples, etc.! We then went
through the forest belt and came upon the great ocean
inlet known as the “basin of Minas,” and, leagues away
the vast bulk of Blomidon shelving bough-like into the
Sea....”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span></p>

<p>To E. A. S.:</p>

<p class="pr6 reduct">(<span class="smcap">On the St. Lawrence</span>),</p>
<p class="pr4 reduct">12th Sept.</p>

<p class="pbq">To-day has been a momentous birthday on the whole&mdash;and
none the less so because I have been alone and, what
is to me an infinite relief, quite unknown. I told no one
about my Saguenay expedition till the last moment&mdash;and
so there is nothing definite about me in the papers save
that I “abruptly left St. John” (the capital of New
Brunswick) and that I am to arrive in Quebec to-morrow.
I sent you a card from Rivière du Loup, the northernmost
township of the old Acadians, and a delightful
place. I reached it early from Temiscouata (the Lake of
Winding Water)&mdash;a journey of extreme interest and
beauty, through a wild and as yet unsettled country. The
track has only been open this summer. Before I reached
its other end (the junction of the St. John river with the
Madawaska) I was heartily sick of New Brunswick, with
its oven-like heat, its vast monotonous forests with
leagues upon leagues of dead and dying trees, and its all
present forest-fires. The latter have caused widespread
disaster.... Several times we were scorched by the
flames, but a few yards away&mdash;and had “to rush” several
places. But once in the province of Quebec, and
everything changed. The fires (save small desultory
ones) disappeared: the pall of smoke lightened and vanished:
and the glorious September foliage made a happy
contrast to the wearisome hundreds of miles of decayed
and decaying firs. It was a most glorious sunset&mdash;one
of the grandest I have ever seen&mdash;and the colour of the
vast Laurentian Mountain range, on the north side of the
St. Lawrence, superb. It was dark when we reached the
mouth of the Saguenay River&mdash;said to be the gloomiest
and most awe-inspiring river in the world&mdash;and began
our sail of close upon a hundred miles (it can be followed
by canoes for a greater length than Great Britain). The
full moon came up, and the scene was grand and solemn
beyond words. Fancy fifty miles of sheer mountains,
one after another without a valley-break, but simply cleft<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
ravines. The deep gloom as we slowly sailed through the
noiseless shadow brooding between Cape Eternity and
Cape Trinity was indescribable. We anchored for some
hours in “Ha! Ha! Bay,” the famous landing place of
the old discoverers. In the early morning we sailed out
from Ha! Ha! Bay, and then for hours sailed down such
scenery as I have never seen before and never expect to
see again.... At Quebec I am first to be the guest of
the well-known Dr. Stewart, and then of Mons. Le Moine
at his beautiful place out near the Indian Village of
Lorette and the Falls of Montmorenci&mdash;not far from the
famous Plain of Abraham, where Wolfe and Montcalm
fought, and an Empire lay in balance.</p>

<p class="p1">In New York, William was the guest of Mr. and Mrs.
E. C. Stedman at 44 East 26th Street, whence he wrote
to me:</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“ ... So much has happened since I wrote to you from
Montreal that I don’t see how I’m to tell you more than
a fraction of it&mdash;particularly as I am seldom alone even
for five minutes. Last week I left Montreal (after having
shot the rapids, etc.) and travelled to Boston via the
White Mountains, through the States of Vermont, Connecticut
and Massachusetts. Boston is a beautiful place&mdash;an
exceedingly fine city with lovely environs. Prof. A.
S. Hardy (’Passe Rose,’ etc.) was most kind.... Cambridge
and Harvard University, are also very fine. I
enjoyed seeing Longfellow’s house (Miss L. still occupies
it) and those of Emerson, Lowell, etc. I spent brief
visits to Prof. Wright of Harvard, to Winsor the historian,
etc. On Sunday afternoon I drove with A. S. H.
to Belmont in Massachusetts, and spent afternoon with
Howells, the novelist. He was most interesting and genial&mdash;I
had the best of welcomes from the Stedmans. They
are kindness personified. The house is lovely, and full of
beautiful things and multitudes of books. I have already
more invitations than I can accept: every one is most
hospitable. I have already met Mr. Gilder, the poet, and
editor of the ‘Century’; Mr. Alden of ‘Harpers’; Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
Bowen, of the ‘Independent’; R. H. Stoddart, the
‘father’ of recent American letters; and heaven knows
how many others. I have been elected honorary member
of the two most exclusive clubs in N. Y., the ‘Century’
and ‘The Players,’ Next week there is to be a special
meeting at the Author’s Club, and I am to be the guest of
the evening....”</p>


<p class="pbqr p1"><span class="smcap">New York</span>, 1:10:89.</p>

<p class="pbq">“Can only send you a brief line by this mail. I enjoyed
my visit to Mr. Alden at Metuchen in New Jersey very
much. Among the new friends I care most for are a
married couple called Janvier. They are true Bohemians
and most delightful. He is a writer and she an artist ...
and both have travelled much in Mexico. We dined together
at a Cuban Café last night. He gave me his vol.
of stories called ‘Colour Studies’ and she a little sketch
of a Mexican haunted house&mdash;both addressed to ‘William
Sharp. Recuerdo di Amistad y carimo.’”</p>

<p class="p1">On leaving New York he wrote to his kind host:</p>


<p class="pbqr p1">Oct. 8, 1889.</p>

<p class="pn"><span class="smcap">My dear Stedman</span>,</p>

<div class="pbq">
<p>This, along with some flowers, will reach you on the
morning of your birthday, while I am far out on the Atlantic.
May the flowers carry to your poet-soul a breath
of that happy life which seems to inspire them&mdash;and may
your coming years be full of the beauty and fragrance of
which they are the familiar and exquisite symbols. You
have won my love as well as my deep regard and admiration.
And so I leave you to understand how earnestly
and truly I wish you all good.</p>

<p>Once more let me tell you how deeply grateful I am to
you and Mrs. Stedman for all your generous kindness to
me. We have all, somewhere, sometime, our gardens,
where&mdash;as Hafiz says&mdash;the roses have a subtler fragrance,
and the nightingales a rarer melody; and my
memory of <i>my</i> last “fortunate Eden” will remain with
me always....</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span></p>

<p>I shall always think of you, and Mrs. Stedman, and
Arthur, as of near and dear relatives. Yes, we <i>are</i> of
one family.</p></div>

<p class="pr8 reduct">Farewell, meanwhile,</p>
<p class="pr6 reduct">Ever your affectionate,</p>
<p class="pr4 reduct"><span class="smcap">William Sharp</span>.</p>

<p class="p1">This note drew from the American poet the following
reply:</p>


<p class="pn1"><span class="smcap">My dear Sharp</span>,</p>

<div class="pbq">
<p>‘Tis quite surprising&mdash;the severity wherewith you
have been missed, in this now very quiet household, since
you looked down upon its members from the Servia’s
upper-deck, very much like Campanini in Lohengrin
when the Swan gets fairly under way! The quiet that
settled down was all the stiller, because you and we had
to get through with so much in your ten days <i>chez nous</i>.
Lay one consolation to heart: you won’t have to do <i>this</i>
again; when you return, ‘twill be to a city of which you
have deduced a general idea, from the turbid phantasmagoria
of your days and nights here. The conclusions on
our side were that we had formed a liking for you such
as we have retained after the visits of very few guests
from the Old World or the New. Well as I knew your
books and record I had the vaguest notion of your <i>self</i>.
‘Tis rare indeed that a clever writer or artist strengthens
his hold upon those who admire his work, by personal
intimacy. What can I say more than to say that we thoroughly
enjoyed your visit; that we think immeasurably
more of you than before you came; that you are upon our
list of friends to whom we are attached for life&mdash;for good
and ill. We know our own class, in taste and breeding,
when we find them&mdash;which is not invariably among our
different guests. Nor can one have your ready art of
charm and winning, without a good heart and comradeship
under it all: even though intent (and rightly) on
nursing his career and making all the points he has a
right to make&mdash;Apropos of this&mdash;I may congratulate
you on the impression you made here on the men and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
women whom you chanced at this season to meet; that
which you left with <i>us</i> passes the border of respect, and
into the warm and even lowland of affection.</p>

<p>That is all I now shall say about our acquaintanceship.
Being an Anglo-Saxon, ‘tis not once in half a decade that
I bring myself to say so much.</p>

<p>And now, my dear boy, what shall I say of the charming
surprise with which you and your florist so punctually
greeted my birthday? At 56 (“oh, woeful when!”) one
is less than ever used to the melting mood, but you drew
a tear to my eyes. The roses are still all over our house,
and the letter is your best autograph in my possession.
We look forward to seeing you again with us, of course&mdash;because,
if for no other reason, you and yours always
have one home ready for you when in the States, at least
while a roof is over our heads, even though the Latin
wolf be howling at our door. Mrs. Stedman avows that
I must give you her love, and joins with me in all the
words of this long letter.</p></div>

<p class="p1">On our return to Hampstead we resumed our Sunday

<p>I am with all my heart glad of your return and the
good news you give of yourself and your wife. He who
travels comes back thrice the man he was, and if you do
not bully my poor Stayathoma, it is in magnanimity.
The moccasins are acceptable for their uses and all that
they tell me. Name a time as early as you can to come

ourselves on the benevolence of friends. Give your wife<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
my best regards. I have questions for her about Tyrol

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER X</h2>

<p class="pch">BROWNING</p>

<p class="pc"><i>The Joseph Severn Memoirs</i></p>

<p class="p2">To William Sharp, as to many others, the closing days
of 1899 brought a deep personal sorrow in the death of
Robert Browning. The younger man had known him for
several years, and had always received a warm welcome
from the Poet in his house in Warwick Crescent which,
with its outlook on the water of broad angle of the canal
with its little tree clad island, he declared laughingly, reminded
him of Venice. And kindly he was too, when,
coming to the first of our “At Homes” in South Hampstead,
he assured me with a genial smile “I like to come,
because I know young people like to have me.”</p>

<p>“It is needless to dwell upon the grief everywhere felt
and expressed for the irreparable loss” (W. S. wrote in
his monograph on Browning). The magnificent closing
lines of Shelley’s “Alastor” have occurred to many a
mourner, for gone indeed was “a surpassing Spirit.” The
superb pomp of the Venetian funeral, the solemn grandeur
of the interment in Westminster Abbey, do not seem
worth recording: so insignificant are all these accidents of
death made by the supreme fact itself. Yet it is fitting
to know that Venice has never in modern times afforded
a more impressive sight than those of craped processional
gondolas following the high flower-strewn famous
barge through the thronged water-ways and out across
the lagoon to the desolate Isle of the Dead: that London
has rarely seen aught more solemn than the fog-dusked
Cathedral spaces, echoing at first with the slow tramp of
the pall-bearers, and then with the sweet aerial music
swaying upward the loved familiar words of the “Lyric
Voice” hushed so long before. Yet the poet was as much
honoured by those humble friends, Lambeth artificers and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
a few working-women, who threw sprays of laurel before
the hearse&mdash;by that desolate, starving, woe-weary gentleman,
shivering in his thread-bare clothes, who seemed
transfixed with a heart-wrung though silent emotion, ere
he hurriedly drew from his sleeve a large white chrysanthemum,
and throwing it beneath the coffin as it was
lifted upward, disappeared in the crowd, which closed
again like the sea upon this lost wandering wave.”</p>

<p>But it was nevertheless difficult to realise that the stimulating
presence had passed away and the cheerful voice
was silent: “It seems but a day or two that I heard from
the lips of the dead poet a mockery of death’s vanity&mdash;a
brave assertion of the glory of life. ‘Death, death! It is
this harping on death I despise so much,’” he remarked
with emphases of gesture as well as of speech&mdash;the inclined
head and body, the right hand lightly placed upon
the listener’s knee, the abrupt change in the inflection of
the voice, all so characteristic of him&mdash;“this idle and
often cowardly as well as ignorant harping! Why should
we not change like everything else? In fiction, in poetry,
in so much of both, French as well as English, and, I am
told, in American art and literature, the shadow of death&mdash;call
it what you will, despair, negation, indifference&mdash;is
upon us. But what fools who talk thus! Why, <i>amico mio</i>,
you know as well as I that death is life, just as our daily,
our momentarily dying body is none the less alive and
ever recreating new forces of existence. Without death,
which is our crapelike churchyardy word for change, for
growth, there could be no prolongation of what we call
life. Pshaw! it is foolish to argue upon such a thing even.
For myself, I deny death as an end of everything. Never
say of me that I am dead!”</p>

<p>On the 4th January, 1890, W. S. wrote to Mr. Thomas
A. Janvier:</p>


<p class="pbqr">London.</p>

<p class="pbq">Many thanks for the <i>Aztec Treasure House</i>, which
opens delightfully and should prove a thrilling tale. I
don’t know how <i>you</i> feel, but for myself I shall never
again publish serially till I have completed the story<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
aforehand. You will have seen that I have been asked and
have agreed to write the critical monograph on Browning
for the <i>Great Writer’s Series</i>. This involves a harassing
postponement of other work, and considerable financial
loss, but still I am glad to do it.</p>

<p class="pbq">The Harlands spent New Year’s Day with us, and the
Champagne was not finished without some of it being
quaffed in memory of the dear and valued friends oversea.
You, both of you, must come over this spring.</p>

<p class="pr4 reduct"><span class="smcap">William Sharp</span>.</p>

<p class="p1">With each New Year a Diary was begun with the intention
of its being carefully continued throughout the
months, an intention however that inevitably was abandoned
as the monotony of the fulfilment palled upon the
writer.</p>

<p>The Diary for 1890 begins with a careful record of
work and events, noted daily till mid February when it
ceases, to be resumed more fitfully in September and October.
The year is prefaced with the motto:</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“C’est à ce lendemain sevère que tout artiste sérieux

how the monograph was written and what other work he
had on hand:</p>

<div class="pbq">
<p class="p1">“<i>Jan. 2nd.</i>&mdash;Wrote the first 3 or 4 pages (tentative) of

<p>“<i>Jan. 3rd.</i>&mdash;(1) Wrote chapter of <i>Ordeal of Basil
Hope</i>. Finished it by 12.30. Then went to R. Academy
Press-View and spent two hours or so in the Galleries.
While walking back to Club from Charing Cross thought
out some opening sentences for <i>Browning</i>, leading to the
wave-theory, beginning&mdash;‘In human history, waves of
intellectual activity concur with other dynamic movements.
It used to be a formula of criticism, etc.’ (wrote
down a couple of Pages at Club). ‘Death is a variation, a
note of lower or higher insistence in the rhythmical sequence
of Life.’”&mdash;W. S.</p>

<p>“<i>Jan. 4th.</i>&mdash;(1) Wrote article of 2,500 words upon Balzac
(for <i>The Scottish Leader</i>). (2) Short ‘London Correspondence’
for <i>G. H.</i> The profoundest insight cannot reach deeper
than its own possibilities of depth. The physiognomy of
the soul is never visible in its entirety&mdash;barely
ever even its profile. The utmost we can expect
to produce (perhaps even to perceive, in the most quintessential
moment), is a partially faithful, partially deceptive
silhouette. Since no human being has ever yet
seen his or her own soul, absolutely impartially and in
all its rounded completeness of good and evil, of strength
and weakness, of what is temporal and perishable and
what is germinal and essential, how can we expect even
the subtlest analyst to depict other souls than his own.
Even in a savage there must be dormant possibilities,
animal and spiritual traits of all kinds, which could to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
a deeper than any human vision (as we can conceive it)
so colour and modify an abstract ‘replica’ as to make
it altogether unlike the picture we should draw.”&mdash;W. S.</p>

<p>“<i>Jan. 5th.</i>&mdash;The first thing the artist should cultivate
if not strongly dowered in this respect by Nature, is Serenity.
A true Serenity&mdash;what Wilfred Meynell, writing
of Browning, in the <i>Athenæum</i> of Friday, calls ‘detachment’&mdash;is
one of the surest inspirers and preservatives
of that clarified psychic emotion which, in compelled or
propelled expressional activity, is the cause of all really
creative work. This true serenity is, of course, as far
removed from a false isolation of spirit or a contemptuous
indifference, as from constant perturbation about
trifles and vulgar anxiety for self.”&mdash;W. S.</p>

<p>“<i>Jan. 6th.</i>&mdash;Felt very unwell this morning.... Heard
from Dr. Garnett of the death last night of Dr. Westland
Marston. (1) Wrote a portion of second series
of ‘Fragments from the Lost Journal of Piero di
Cosimo’ (one of a series of Imaginary portraits I am
slowly writing for magazine publication in the first instance).
(2) ‘London Letter’ Reminiscences of Dr.
Marston, etc.”</p>

<p>“<i>Jan. 10th.</i>&mdash;Wrote a chapter of <i>Basil Hope</i>. In evening
we went to Mona’s. A pretty large gathering. Roussel
told me he wanted to paint my portrait, and asked
me to give him sittings. Some one was speaking of a
poem by Browning being superlatively fine because of its
high optimism and ethical message. The question is not
one of weighty message, but of artistic presentation. To
praise a poem because of its optimism is like commending
a peach because it loves the sunshine, rather than
because of its distinguishing bloom and savour. To urge
that a poem is great because of its high message is almost
as uncritical as it would be obviously absurd to aver
that a postman is illustrious because of some epic or
history he may carry in his bag. In a word, the first
essential concern of the artist must be with his vehicle.
In the instance of a poet, this vehicle is language emotioned
to the white-heat of rhythm<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>.”</p>

<p>“<i>Jan. 12th.</i>&mdash;Wrote first portion of Elegiac Poem on
‘Browning’ commencing:</p></div>

<p class="pph6 p1">There is darkness everywhere;<br />
Scarce is the city limned</p>
<p class="ppn7">In shadow on the lagoon.</p>
<p class="pph6">No wind in the heavy air.<br />
The stars themselves are dimmed,</p>
<p class="ppn7">And a mist veils the moon.</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“After lunch took T. Mavor to Alfred East’s to see his
Japanese pictures. Then I took T. M. to John M. Swan’s
Studio. Then we went to spend half an hour with Stepniak
and his wife at 13 Grove Gardens.”</p>

<p class="pbq">“<i>Jan. 13th.</i>&mdash;Late in settling down, and then disinclined
to write except in verse. Wrote the second and
final part of the Elegaic Browning Poem for <i>Belford’s
Magazine</i>. It is not often that I indulge in inversions:
but the gain is sometimes noticeable. I think it is in this
stanza:</p>

<p class="pph6 p1">Alas, greatness is not, nor is<br />
There aught that is under the sun,</p>
<p class="ppn7">Nor any mortal thing,</p>
<p class="pph6">Neither the heights of bliss<br />
Nor the depths of evil done,</p>
<p class="ppn7">Unshadowed by Death’s wing.”</p>

<p class="p1">He soon found that it was impossible to write the
monograph in London&mdash;with its ceaseless demands and
distractions. Under the pressure of much work he became
so unwell that we realised he could not finish the
book under existing conditions, therefore arranged that
he should leave me in charge of work at home and he
should go to Hastings and devote himself mainly to his
<i>Browning</i>. On the 18th he records, from rooms overlooking
the sea “Blew a gale at night. The noise of the
sea like a vast tide in a hollow echoing cavern: and a
shrill screaming wail in the wind. Began my <i>Life of
Browning</i>. To bed at 12.”</p>

<p>Then follows a record of the work done day by day:
on the 19th, twelve printed pages: on the 20th ten pages:
on the 21st four only because he lunched with Coventry
Patmore who was then residing at Hastings. On the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
22nd, thirteen pages; on the 23rd, eleven pages, and five
letters.</p>

<p class="pbq p1"><i>Jan. 26th</i> has this note: “We can no more predict
Browning’s place in literature as it will be esteemed by
posterity than we can specify the fauna and flora of a
planet whose fires have not yet sufficiently cooled to enable
vegetation to grow.”</p>

<p class="p1">His stay at Hastings was rendered pleasant by the
neighbourliness of Coventry Patmore with whom he had
many long talks, and by occasional visits to Miss Betham
Edwards who had a house on the hill beyond the old
castle.</p>

<p>He returned to town at the beginning of February.</p>

<p>On the 4th he wrote “the first scene of a Play (to be
called either “The Lover’s Tragedy,” or “The Tower of
Silence”) which was afterward rewritten and published
in <i>Vistas</i> as “A Northern Night.”</p>

<p>The Diary continues:</p>

<div class="pbq">
<p class="p1">“<i>8th February.</i> Began about 10.30. (1) Wrote the rest
of Imaginary Journal (Piero di Cosimo) i. e. about 2,000
words. In evening posted it to Mavor for March issue
of <i>The Art Review</i>. (2) Wrote long London Letter
for G. H. (2,000 words). (3) Began at 9.30 to do
<i>Browning</i>. Including quotations did 10 printed pages.
Re-read the early books of ‘The Ring and the Book.’
To bed at 2.30. Tired somewhat after writing to-day,
in all, about 7,000 words (less Browning’s quotations).</p>

<p>“<i>Sunday 9th.</i> Breakfast at eleven&mdash;Worked at Browning
matter till 5 (in bed). In evening Mona, and Mathilde
came in and Frank Rinder, Ernest Rhys, etc. Wrote
<i>Young Folk’s Paper</i> article. Read up till about 3 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span></p>

<p><i>10th.</i> Worked six hours on end at Browning material.
Between tea and dinner wrote Chap. 18 of <i>Ordeal of Basil
Hope</i>; after dinner wrote Chap. 19. At 10 went up to
Mona’s to fetch Lill. Egmont Hake there, W. Earl Hodgson
and Miss Shedlock, Mathilde Blind.</p>

<p><i>11th.</i> At British Museum all day, working at ‘Odes.’
(This selection of Odes in the <i>Canterbury Poets</i>.)</p>

<p>In evening wrote six p. p. of <i>Browning</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span></p>

<p><i>12th.</i> (1) In first part of day wrote 6 pages of <i>Browning</i>.
(2) Short London Letter for G. H. From 5 to 8 I
wrote Chap. 20 of <i>Basil Hope</i>. (4) After dinner (between
9 and 12.30) wrote 8 more pages of <i>Browning</i> (14 in all
to-day).</p>

<p><i>13th.</i> Wrote 12 pages of <i>Browning</i> and Chap. XXI
of <i>Basil Hope</i>.</p>

<p>“<i>February 14th.</i>&mdash;In morning, late afternoon and
evening (from 9-12) wrote in all 18 printed pages of
<i>Browning</i>, or, including quotation, 21.”</p></div>

<p class="p2">Here the Diary abruptly ends. I do not recollect on
what date the <i>Browning</i> was finished, but it was published
in the early autumn. And I have no recollection
as to what became of <i>The Ordeal of Basil Hope</i>, whether
or not it ever appeared serially, but I think not. It never
was issued in book form&mdash;and from the time we gave
up the house in Goldhurst Terrace he never gave it a
thought. It was characteristic of him that when a piece
of work was finished or discarded, it passed wholly out
of his mind, for his energies were always centred on his
work on hand and on that projected.</p>

<p>He was a careful student of the progress of contemporary
literatures&mdash;especially French (including Belgian)
Italian and American&mdash;and during the spring and summer
he wrote a long article on American literature for
<i>The National Review</i>, an article on D’Annunzio for <i>The
Fortnightly</i>. He also prepared a volume in English of
selected Essays of St. Beuve for which he wrote a careful
critical Preface.</p>

<p>The three years at Hampstead had been happy and successful.
William had regained health; and had a command
of work that made the ways of life pleasant. We
had about us a genial sympathetic group of friends, and
were in touch with many keen minds of the day. Temperamentally
he could work or play with equal jest and
enjoyment; he threw himself whole-heartedly into whatever
he did. Observant, keenly intuitive, he cared to come
into contact with all kinds and types of men and women;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
cared continually to test the different minds and temperaments
he came across, providing always that they
had a vital touch about them, and were not comatosely
conventional. Curious about life, he cared incessantly to
experiment; restless and never satisfied (I do not mean
dissatisfied) he constantly desired new fields for this
experimentation. Therefore, happy though he had been
at Wescam, successful as that experiment had proved,
he felt it had served its turn and he longed for different
circumstances, different environment, new possibilities in
which to attempt to give fuller expression of himself. He
realised that nothing more would happen under the then
existing conditions, satisfactory though they seemed externally;
that indeed the satisfactoriness was a chain that
was winding round him and fettering him to a form of
life that was becoming rigid and monotonous, and, therefore,
paralysing to all those inner impulses. His visit to
America had re-awakened the desire to wander. So we
gave up our house, stored our furniture, and planned to
go abroad for the first winter and leave the future “in
the lap of the Gods”; for was he not “of the unnumbered
clan that know a longing that is unquiet as the restless
wave ...” the “deep hunger for experience, even if it
be bitter, the longing for things known to be unattainable,
the remembrance that strives for rebirth.” That
summer he wrote to Mr. Stedman:</p>

<p>“ ... You will ere this have received the copy of the
little book of <i>Great Odes: English and American</i> which
I sent to you. I think I told you that your own beautiful
‘Ode to Pastoral Romance’ has appealed to many people,
and will, I hope and believe, send new readers to
you, among the new generation, as a poet. Well, we are
breaking up our home, and are going to leave London
for a long time&mdash;probably for ever as a fixed ‘residentz
platz.’ Most of my acquaintances think I am very foolish
thus to withdraw from the ‘thick of the fight’ just when
things are going so well with me, and when I am making
a good and rapidly increasing income&mdash;for I am giving
up nearly every appointment I hold, and am going abroad,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
having burned my ships behind me, and determined to
begin literary life anew. But, truly enough, wisdom does
not lie in money making&mdash;not for the artist who cares
for his work at any rate. I am tired of so much pot-boiling,
such increasing bartering of literary merchandise:
and wish to devote myself entirely&mdash;or as closely
as the fates will permit&mdash;to work in which my heart is.
I am buoyant with the belief that it is in me to do something
both in prose and verse far beyond any hitherto
accomplishment of mine: but to stay here longer, and let
the net close more and more round me, would be fatal.
Of course I go away at a heavy loss. My income will at
once drop to zero, and even after six months or so will
scarce have risen a few degrees above that awkward limit&mdash;though
ultimately things may readjust themselves.
Yet I would rather&mdash;I am ready&mdash;I should say <i>we</i> are
ready&mdash;to live in the utmost economy if need be. We
shall be none the less happy: for my wife, with her usual
loving unselfishness and belief in me, is as eager as I am
for the change, despite all the risks. Among the younger
writers few have the surely not very high courage necessary
to give up something of material welfare for the
sake of art. As for us, we are both at heart Bohemians&mdash;and
are well content if we can have good shelter, enough
to eat, books, music, friends, sunshine and free nature&mdash;all
of which we can have with the scantiest of purses.
Perhaps I should be less light-hearted in the matter if
I thought that our coming Bohemian life might involve
my wife in hard poverty when my hour comes, but fortunately
her future is assured. So henceforth, in a word,
I am going to take down the board</p>

<p class="p1">This day week we leave our house for good. My wife
and I then go into Hampshire to breathe the hay and the
roses for a week at a friend’s place, 7 miles across the
Downs north of Winchester: then back to London to stay
with our friend, Mrs. Mona Caird, till about the 20th of
July. About that date we go to Scotland, to my joy, till
close on the end of September. Thereafter we return
to London for a week or so, and then go abroad. We are
bound first for the lower Rhineland, and intend to stay
at Heidelberg (being cheap, pretty, thoroughly German,
with good music and a good theatre) for about two
months. Then, about the beginning of December, we go
to Rome, where we intend to settle: climatic, financial,
and other considerations will decide whether we remain
there longer than six months, but six ideal months at least
we hope for. <i>Mihi sex menses satis sunt vitæ septimum
Orco spondeo.</i></p>

<p class="p2">That summer we went to Clynder on the Gareloch,
Argyll, in order to be near my husband’s old friend, Dr.
Donald Macleod, who, as he records in his diary “sang
to me with joyous abandonment a Neapolitan song, and
asked me to send him a MS. from Italy for <i>Good Words</i>.”
While we were in the West we made acquaintance with
the poet-editor of <i>The Yorkshire Herald</i>, George Cotterell,
who became a dear and valued friend. I cannot recall
if it were in the early summer of 1889 or 1890 that
my husband was first approached on the subject of the
<i>Joseph Severn Memoirs</i>, but I remember the circumstance.
We spent a week-end in Surrey with some old
friends of my mother, Sir Walter and Lady Hughes, and
one morning Mr. Walter Severn, the painter, walked over
to luncheon. He spoke about my husband’s <i>Life of
Rossetti</i>, then of the quantity of unpublished MSS. he and
his family had written by and relating to his father,
Joseph Severn, “the friend of Keats.” Finally he proposed
that his listener should take over the MSS., put
them in form and write a Life of Severn, with, as the
special point of literary interest, his father’s devoted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
friendship with and care of the dying poet. After considerable
deliberation, W. S. agreed to undertake the
work, and arrangements were made with Messrs. Samson
Low to publish it. The preparing of this Memoir brought
him into pleasant relationship not only with Mr. Walter
Severn, and with Mr. and Mrs. Arthur Severn, but also
with Ruskin, who he visited later at Coniston, where he
was delighted, among other things, with the fine collection
of minerals and stones that was one of Ruskin’s
hobbies.</p>

<p>The preparation of <i>The Joseph Severn Memoirs</i> necessarily
entailed correspondence with members and friends
of that family, among others with W. W. Story, the sculptor,
who sent him the following information:</p>

<p>“I knew Mr. Severn at Rome and frequently met and
saw him but I can recall nothing which would be of value
to you. He was, as you know, a most pleasant man&mdash;and
in the minds of all is associated with the memory of
Keats by whose side he lies in the Protestant Cemetery
at Rome. When the bodies were removed, as they were
several years ago, and laid side by side, there was a little
funeral ceremony and I made an address on the occasion
in honour and commemoration of the two friends. I remember
we then had hoped that Lord Houghton would
have been able to be present as he had promised. But
he was taken ill in the East, where he was then journeying,
and I had to express the fear lest the ceremony might
be a commemoration not only of two but of the three
friends so intimately associated together. However,
Houghton did recover from the attack and came afterward
to Rome, sadly broken.”</p>

<p>Early in October my husband and I crossed to Antwerp
and stopped at Bonn. The Rhine disappointed William’s
expectations. He wrote to a friend: “The real charm of
the Rhine, beyond the fascination that all rivers and riverine
scenery have for most people, is that of literary and
historical romance. The Rhine is in this respect the Nile
of Europe: though probably none but Germans feel thus
strongly. For myself I cannot but think it ought not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
to be a wholly German river, but from every point of
view be the Franco-German boundary.... Germany has
much to gain from a true communion with its more
charming neighbour. The world would jog on just the
same if Germany were annihilated by France, Russia
and Italy: but the disappearance of brilliant, vivacious,
intellectual France would be almost as serious a loss to
intellectual Europe, as would be to the people at large the
disappearance of the Moon.”</p>

<p>From Rome he wrote to Mrs. Janvier:</p>


<p class="pbqr p1">Dec., 1890.</p>

<div class="pbq">
<p>“ ... Well, we were glad to leave Germany. Broadly,
it is a joyless place for Bohemians. It is all beer, coarse
jokes, coarse living, and domestic tyranny on the man’s
part, subjection on the woman’s&mdash;on the one side: pedantic
learning, scientific pedagogism, and mental <i>ennui</i>; on
the other: with, of course, a fine leavening <i>somewhere</i> of
the salt of life. However, it is only fair to say that we
were not there at the best season in which to see the
blither side of Germans and German life. I saw a good
deal of the southern principalities and kingdoms&mdash;the
Rhine provinces, Baden, Würtemberg, and Bavaria. Of
course Heidelberg, where we stayed six wet weeks, is the
most picturesque of the residential places (towns like
Frankfort-am-Main and Mannheim are only for merchants
and traders, though they have music “galore”),
but I would rather stay at Stuttgart than any I saw. It is
wonderfully animated and pleasing for a German town,
and has a charming double attraction both as a mediæval
city and as a modern capital. There, too, I have a friend:
the American novelist, Blanche Willis Howard (author
of <i>Guenn</i>, <i>The Open Door</i>, etc.), who is now the wife of
the Court-Physician to the King of Würtemberg and rejoices
in the title “Frau Hof-Arzt von Teuffel.” Dr. von
Teuffel himself is one of the few Germans who seem to
regard women as equals.</p>

<p>“But what a relief it was to be in Italy again, though<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
not just at first, for the weather at Verona was atrocious,
and snow lay thick past Mantua to Bologna. But once
the summit of the Apennines was reached, and the magnificent
and unique prospect of Florentine Tuscany lay
below, flooded in sunshine and glowing colour (though
it was in the second week of December) we realised that
at last we were in Italy.... When we came to Rome we
had at first some difficulty in getting rooms which at once
suited our tastes and our pockets. But now we are settled
in an “apartment” of 3-1/2 rooms, within a yard or so
of the summit of the Quirinal Hill. The 1/2 is a small
furnished corridor or ante-room: the comfortable <i>salotto</i>,
is at once our study, drawing-room, and parlour.</p>

<p>“We have our coffee and our fruit in the morning: and
when we are in for lunch our old landlady gives us delightful
colazioni of maccaroni and tomatoes, or spinach
and lentils, or eggs and something else, with roasted
chestnuts and light wine and bread. We have our dinner
sent in from a trattoria.</p>

<p>“In a sense, I have been indolent of late: but I have
been thinking much, and am now, directly or indirectly,
occupied with several ambitious undertakings. Fiction,
other imaginative prose, and the drama (poetic and
prose), besides a lyrical drama, and poetry generally,
would fain claim my pen all day long. As for my lyrical
drama&mdash;which is the only poetic work not immediately
modern in theme&mdash;which is called ‘Bacchus in India’;
my idea is to deal in a new and I hope poetic way with
Dionysos as the Joy-Bringer, the God of Joyousness. In
the first part there is the union of all the links between
Man and the World he inhabits: Bacchus goes forth in
joy, to give his serene message to all the world. The
second part, ‘The Return,’ is wild disaster, and the bitterness
of shame: though even there, and in the Epilogue,
will sound the clarion of a fresh Return to Joy. I transcribe
and enclose the opening scene for you&mdash;as it at
present stands, unrevised. The ‘lost God’ referred to
in the latter part is really that deep corrosive Melancholy
whom so many poets and artists&mdash;from Dante and Durer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
to our own time&mdash;have dimly descried as a terrible
Power.</p>

<p>“At the moment I am most of all interested in my blank-verse
tragedy. It deals with a most terrible modern instance
of the scriptural warming as to the sins of the
father being visited upon his children: an instance where
the father himself shares the doom and the agony. Then
I have also schemed out, and hope soon to get on with,
a prose play, dealing with the deep wrong done to women
by certain existing laws. Among other prose books (fiction)
which I have “on the stocks” nothing <i>possesses</i>
me more than a philosophical work which I shall probably
publish either anonymously or under a pseudonym, and,
I hope, before next winter. How splendid it is to be
alive! O if one could only crush into a few vivid years
the scattered fruit of wasted seasons. There is such a
host of things to do: such a bitter sparsity of time, after
bread-and-butter making, to do them in&mdash;even to dream
of them!”</p></div>

<p class="p2">These various schemes planned mentally were never
realised. William constantly projected and of the
roughly drafted out possible work that absorbed him during
its conception, but was put aside when a more dominating
idea demanded full expression. “Bacchus in India”
remained a fragment. Neither the tragedy nor that
prose play was finished, and the philosophical work was
never begun. A new impulse came, new work grew out
of the impressions of that Roman winter which swept out
of his mind all other cartooned work.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XI</h2>

<p class="pch">ROME</p>

<p class="pc"><i>Sospiri di Roma</i></p>

<p class="p2">Winter in Rome was one long delight to the emancipated
writer. It amply fulfilled even his optimistic anticipation.
He revelled in the sunshine and the beauty;
he was in perfect health; his imagination was quickened
and worked with great activity. We had about us a little
group of friends, who, like ourselves, intended to live
quietly and simply. Among these were Mrs. Caird who
had come abroad for her health; Sir Charles Holroyd,
who had a studio in the Via Margoutta, and Mr. and
Mrs. Elihu Vedder. Mrs. Wingate Rinder joined us for
three weeks, and with her my husband greatly enjoyed
long walks over the Campagna and expeditions to the little
neighbouring hill towns. His Diary for the beginning
of 1891 was kept with creditable regularity, and contains
a record of some of these expeditions and of work done in
Rome, in particular of the dates on which the poems of
<i>Sospiri di Roma</i> were written. From it I have selected
entries.</p>

<div class="pbq">
<p class="p1">“<i>Jan. 2nd.</i> ... Read through and revised ‘Bacchus
in India.’ Added the (I think good) adjective ‘sun-sparkled
wood....”</p>

<p>Poetry is a glorious rebirth of prose. When a beautiful
thought can be uttered in worthy prose: best so. But
when it moves through the mind in music, and shapes
itself to a lyric rhythm, then it should find expression in
poetry. The truest poets are those who can most exquisitely
capture, and concentrate in a few words, this
haunting rhythm.</p>

<p><i>Jan. 3rd.</i> The morning broke well, though not so promisingly
as yesterday.... Caught the 9 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span> train for Albano-Laziale.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
Marnio is a fine and picturesque hill-city.
After passing it we admired the view of the Lake of
Albano, with its abrupt variations of light and profound
shadow. Arrived at Albano we walked by the way of
the Viaduct to L’Ariccia, with lovely views of the Campagna
to the right: of Monte Cavo and Rocca di Papa
to the left. Then on by a lovely road to Genzano. Having
gone through the lower part and out again into the
Campagna we turned southward, and in due time reached
the high ground, with its olive-orchards, looking down
upon the Lake of Nemi. It looked lovely in its grey-blue
stillness, with all the sunlit but yet sombre winterliness
around. Nemi, itself, lay apparently silent and lifeless,
‘a city of dream,’ on a height across the lake. One could
imagine that Nemi and Genzano had once been the same
town, and had been riven asunder by a volcano. The
lake-filled crater now divides these two little hill-set
towns.... Walked through Albano to the N.W. gate,
past the ancient tomb, and along the beautiful ilex-bordered
road leading to Castel-Gandolfo. Saw two Capuchin
friars with extraordinary faces. They fitted the
scene. Magnificent views of the Campagna, tinted with
a faint pink-grey mist: of Ostea, etc.: and of the strange
dreamful, partially sunlit Tyrrhene sea. Then through
Castel Gandolfo, with lovely views of Lake Albano.
Broke our fast with some apples. Down the steep front
till we joined the road just above the little station, where
we caught the train 10 minutes later. The Aqua Felice
and Claudian Aqueducts seen to great advantage in returning
across the Campagna to Rome.</p>

<p><i>Jan. 5th.</i> A fine morning, with a delicate hint of
Spring in the air.... Caught the train for Champino,
near Frascati. The officials at the station seemed amazed
at our descending there. No one ever does so, it seems!
There was literally no regular way out of the station, and
when I asked how we were to get out the man did not
know. Neither he nor the clerk, nor the others who gathered
round knew the road back to Rome! At last some
one from the train suggested that if we struck across<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
country we would come to the Via Appia. We had a
pleasant walk across a barren part of the Campagna
intersected by railway cuttings, and at last came to a
place called Frattochie, whence a road led us to the Via
Appia Nuova. From this again we struck across a field
and came upon the Via Appia Antica, adown which we
had a splendid and absolutely solitary walk. We saw
no one but a few shepherds at a distance, with their large
white dogs and sheep. Often stopped among the ruins,
or at the top of one of the grassy tombs to hear the wind
among the pines, along the grass, or in the crevices of
the wall. A few drops of rain fell as we neared the tomb
of Cecilia Metella, and soon the rain-storm, which we
had watched approaching across the Campagna, came on.
The first three wayside <i>trattorie</i> we came to were shut,
but in the fourth, a peasant’s resort, we got some bread,
and white and poor Marino. We shared some of the
bread with a large dog, and gave some wine to a malarious-looking
poor devil of a labourer. Returned by the
Gate of San Sebastiano.</p>

<p><i>Jan. 8th.</i> ... Bought <i>L’Evolution des Genres dans
l’Histoire de la Littérature</i> by Ferdinand Brunetière;
Roux’s book on Italian Literature; Pierre Loti’s <i>Mariage
de Loti</i>. After dinner copied out ‘Rebirth’ (Spring’s
Advent) to send to <i>Belford’s</i>, and ‘The Sheik’ for <i>N. Y.
Independent</i>.</p>

<p>This forenoon the house nearly opposite fell in. We
saw one man brought out dead. Seven others were said
to be buried in the ruins. The King came later on and
himself helped one of the wounded out and took him to
the hospital.</p>

<p><i>Jan. 9th.</i> Wet and rain. The Campagna covered with
snow. In the forenoon I wrote four more of my ‘Ebb
and Flow’ Series of Sea Poems&mdash;‘Phosphorescence
before Storm’&mdash;‘Tempest Music’&mdash;‘Dead Calm: Noon’
and ‘Dead Calm: Midnight.’ The others were written
some on the French coast some on the English in 1887.
‘Tempest-Music’ and the two ‘Dead Calm’ are as good
if not better than any in the series. In all the latter I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
care most for the ‘Swimmer at Sunrise’ and ‘The Dead-Calm-Noon’:
also for ‘Tempest Music.’</p>

<p>... After dinner read to Lill for a bit including the
prose version (outline) of my “Lilith.”</p>

<p>To-day the anniversary of the Death of Victor Emmanuel,
13 years ago. The Italians idolise his memory,
and call him “The Father of the Country.” He is rapidly
becoming a Presiding Deity. 10th rewrote and greatly
improved “Phosphorescence.” Its two opening lines,
originally,</p></div>

<p class="ppq6 p1">“As hill winds and sun and rains inweave a veil<br />
Of lichen round vast boulders on the mountain side.”</p>

<p class="pbqn p1">were out of keeping in imagery with the rest: and in
every way</p>

<p class="ppq6 p1">“As some aerial spirit weaves a rainbow veil<br />
Of Mist, his high immortal loveliness to hide.”</p>

<div class="pbq">
<p class="pn">are better. Should have preferred “wild” to “high”
in this line, but the 4th terminal is “wild.” Perhaps not,
after all.</p>

<p><i>Jan. 16th.</i> Although it was so cold and wintry with
signs of snow in suspension caught the train for Tivoli.
The scenery extremely beautiful, and doubly fascinating
and strange from the whirling snow falling every here
and there, in strangely intermittent and separate fashion.
The sheep and disconsolate shepherds on one high healthy
part made a fantastic foreground. At Tivoli, which was
like a hill town in Scotland in midwinter, with a storm
raging, we walked past the first cascades, then up a narrow
hill-path partly snowed up, partly frozen, to the
open country beyond. Then back and into a trattoria
where we had lunch of wine, omelette, bread, fruit, and
coffee.</p>

<p><i>Jan. 17th.</i> Midwinter with a vengeance. Rome might
be St. Petersburg. Snow heavy and a hard frost. Even
the Fountain of the Tritone hung all over with long
spears and pendicles of ice.&mdash;Later, I went out, to walk
to and fro on the Pincio Terrace in the whirling snow,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
which I enjoyed beyond words. There was a lull, and
then I saw the storm clouds sweep up from the Maremma,
across the Campagna and blot out Rome bit by bit.
Walking to and fro I composed the lyric, beginning:</p></div>

<p class="ppq6 p1">“There is a land of dream:<br />
I have trodden its golden ways:<br />
I have seen its amber light<br />
From the heart of its sun-swept days:<br />
I have seen its moonshine white<br />
On its silent waters gleam&mdash;<br />
Ah, the strange, sweet, lonely delight<br />
Of the Valleys of Dream!”</p>

<p class="pbqn p1">Returning by the Pincian Gate, about 5.45 there was a
strange sight. Perfectly still in the sombre Via di Mura,
with high walls to the right, but the upper pines and
cypresses swaying in a sudden rush of wind: to the left
a drifting snow-storm: to the right wintry moonshine:
vivid sweeping pulsations of lightning from the Campagna,
and long low muttering growls of thunder. (The
red light from a window in the wall.)</p>

<p class="pbq"><i>Jan. 19th.</i> After dinner read a good deal of Beddoes
to Lill.... How like Poe the first stanza of ‘The Old
Ghost’: every now and again there is a gleam of rare
moon-white beauty, as in the lovely 3rd stanza of ‘The
Ballad of Human Life’&mdash;the first quatrain of the 2nd
stanza of ‘Dial Thoughts,’ and that beautiful line in the
fantastic and ultra-Shelleyian ‘Romance of the Lily,’</p>

<p class="pps6 p1">‘As Evening feeds the waves with brooks of quiet life.’</p>

<div class="pbq">
<p class="p1"><i>Jan. 22nd.</i> In the evening read through Elihu Vedder’s
<i>Primitive Folk</i>. There is a definite law in the evolution
of sexual <i>morale</i>, I am sure, if one could only get at it.
The matter is worth going into, both for Fundamental
and Contemporary and Problematical Ethics.</p>

<p><i>Jan. 27th.</i> Elizabeth and I went to the opening lecture
of the Archæological Society, at the Hotel Marini. Lord
Dufferin in the Chair. Mr. Porter, U. S. Minister, delivered
an address, mainly on Cicero.... Lord Dufferin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
afterwards told us incidentally that a friend of his had
gone into a book shop in the Corso and asked for <i>Max
O’Rell: En Amérique</i>. The bookseller said he neither
had the book nor had he heard of it: now the visitor persisted
and the bookseller in despair exclaimed, ‘<i>Dio mio</i>,
Signor, I never even heard of <i>Marc Aurèle</i> having been
in America!’</p>

<p><i>Jan. 30th.</i> After lunch we went for a drive in the
Campagna.... Delighting in the warm balmy air, the
superb views, the space and freedom, the soft turfy soil
under foot, the excited congregation of larks twittering
as they wheeled about, soon to pair, and one early songster
already trilling his song along the flowing wind high
overhead.</p>

<p>Between 9 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span> and 12 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span> my ears were full of music.
Wrote the Sospiri, ‘The Fountain of the Aqua Paola’;
‘Ruins’; ‘High Noon at Midsummer on the Campagna’;
‘Sussurri’; ‘Breath of the Grass’; ‘Red Poppies’; and
the lyric Spring.</p>

<p><i>Jan. 31st.</i> Wrote to-day. ‘The Mandolin’ (<i>Sospiri di
Roma</i>) (115 lines). In afternoon wrote ‘All’ Ora della
Stella’ (Vesper Bells), partly from memory of what I
have heard, several times, and partly modified by a poem
I chanced to see to-day, Fogazzaro’s ‘A Sera.’</p>

<p><i>February 2nd.</i> Second day of the Carnival. Wrote
all forenoon and part of afternoon. Took up and revised
‘The Fountain of the Aqua Paola’ and added so largely
to it as to make it a new poem. It ended with ‘Eternal
Calm.’ Also wrote ‘The Fallen Goddess’&mdash;about 250
lines in length. In the evening wrote ‘Bats’ Wings’ (26
ll) and ‘Thistledown’ (Spring on the Campagna) (71
ll).</p>

<p>Such bursts of uncontrollable poetic impulse as came
to me to-day, and the last three days, only come rarely
in each year. It was in such a burst last year (1889?)
that I wrote ‘The Weird of Michael Scott’ (each part
at a single sitting).</p>

<p><i>Feb. 4th.</i> Wrote the Sospiro ‘To my Dream.’</p>

<p><i>Feb. 5th.</i> Between 10 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span> and 1.30 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span> wrote the poem<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
which I think I will call ‘Fior di Memoria’ (about 175
lines).</p>

<p><i>Feb. 7th.</i> We went to Ettore Roesler Franz’s studio.
His water-colour drawings of (mediæval) Rome as it was
from the middle of the century to within the last 7 or
10 years very charming and deeply interesting and valuable&mdash;and
at the same time infinitely sad. Those of the
Prati di Castello and the Tiber Bank and Stream especially
so: instead of this lost beauty we have hideous
jerry buildings, bad bridges, monotonous and colourless
banks, and dull municipal mediocrity and common-place
everywhere.</p>

<p>There might be a Weeping Wall in Rome as well as
in Jerusalem. Truly enough there will soon be absolute
truth in Bacon’s noble saying ‘The souls of the living
are the beauty of the world’&mdash;for the world will be reduced
to the sway of the plumber and builder, and artificial
gardener and Bumbledom.</p>

<p>In evening wrote “Primo Sospiro di Primavera.”</p>

<p><i>8th.</i> In forenoon wrote “The White Peacock” (56
lines)&mdash;a study in Whites for Théodore Roussel. Also
“The Swimmer of Nemi” (Red and White) 42 lines. In
evening revised the “Swimmer of Nemi” and partly
rewrote or recast. It is much improved in definite effect;
and gains by the deletion of 9 or 10 lines, pretty in themselves
but not in perfect harmony. Wrote the poem commemorating
the strange evening of 17th Jan.... called
it “A Winter Evening” (35 lines). <i>Later.</i> Wrote the
poem called “Scirocco” (June), 67 lines. To bed about
12.30.</p>

<p><i>10th.</i> Gave first sitting to Charles Holroyd for his
Etching of me.</p>

<p><i>11th.</i> Gave Charles Holroyd a second sitting. Between
9 and 2 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span> wrote</p>

<p>
“The Naked Rider” (70 lines)<br />
“The Wind at Fidenae” (38 lines)<br />
“The Wild Mare” (32 lines)<br />
“A Dream at Ardea” (In Maremma) 215 lines.<br />
</p>

<p><i>12th.</i> Wrote “La Velia” (38 lines).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span></p>

<p><i>15th.</i> Agnes and Lill, Charles Holroyd and the P&mdash;s
and I went to Tusculum by morning train. Very
warm as soon as we got to Frascati. Lovely Tramontana
day. Took a donkey to carry the wine and provisions: or
Lill, if necessary. After a long walk, lunched in the
Theatre at Tusculum. Wreathed the donkey with ivy
and some early blooms, and then I rode on it on to the
stage, à la Bacchus, flasks of Frascati under either arm.</p>

<p>Most glorious sunset. The view from the height above
Tusculum simply superb, and worth coming to see from
any part of the world.</p>

<p><i>17th.</i> Yesterday was one of the most glorious days
possible in Rome. Cloudless sky: fresh sweet breeze:
deliciously warm. Went with A. to Porto d’Anzio
again, and walked along the coast northward. Sea unspeakably
glorious: blue, sunlit, with great green foam-crested
waves breaking on the sands, and surging in
among the hollow tufa rocks and old Roman remains.
Lay for a long time at the extreme end of the Arco Muto.
One of the red letter days in one’s life.</p>

<p>Stayed up all night (till Breakfast) writing: then revising.
Between 8 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span> and 4 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span> wrote poem after poem
with unbroken eagerness. The impulse was an irresistible
one, as I was tired and not, at first, strongly inclined
to write, though no sooner had I written the Italian “Dedicatory
Lines” than it all came upon me. In all, besides
these, I wrote “Al Far della Notte” (31 lines): “Clouds,
from the Agro Romano” (31): “The Olives of Tivoli”
(30): “At Veii” (86): “The Bather” (68): “De Profundis”
(26): and “Ultimo Sospiro” (37).</p>

<p><i>18th.</i> Beautiful day. Felt none the worse for being
up all night. Wrote article on Ibsen’s ‘Rosmersholm’
for Y. F. P. Wrote “Spuma dal Mare” (41 lines).</p></div>

<p class="pbq">In “Spuma dal Mare” I have attempted to give something
of the many-coloured aspects of the sea. It is
absurd to keep on always speaking of it as blue, or green,
or even grey. The following portion is as true as practicable,
whatever other merits they may have:</p>

<p class="ppn6 p1">Here the low breakers are rolling thro’ shallows,<br />
Yellow and muddied, the line of topaz<br />
Ere cut from the boulder:<br />
Save when the sunlight swims through them slantwise,<br />
When inward they roll,<br />
Long billows of amber,<br />
Crown’d with pale yellow<br />
And gray-green spume.<br />
Here wan gray their slopes<br />
Where the broken lights reach them,<br />
Dull gray of pearl, and dappled and darkling,<br />
As when, ‘mid the high<br />
Northward drift of the clouds,<br />
Sirocco bloweth<br />
With soft fanning breath.</p>

<div class="pbq">
<p class="p1"><i>20th.</i> In morning wrote out Dedicatory and other
Preliminary Pages, etc., etc., for my “Sospiri di Roma”
and after lunch took the complete MS. to Prof. Garlanda
of the Societa Laziale, who will take them out to the
Establishment at Tivoli to-day. Holroyd came with final
proof of his etching of me.</p>

<p><i>24th.</i> Wrote “The Shepherd in Rome” (66 lines).</p>

<p><i>25th.</i> Wrote “Sorgendo La Luna” (47 ll.).</p>

<p><i>27th.</i> Wrote poem “In July: on the Campagna”
(26 ll.). Wrote poem “August Afternoon in Rome”
(59 ll.).</p></div>

<p class="p1">Charles M. Ross (Norwegian painter), and Julian Corbett
(author of “The Life of Drake”) called on me today.
Mr. Ross wants to paint me in pastel and has asked
me to go to-morrow for that purpose.”</p>

<p>In mid-March I went to Florence in advance of my
husband; and he and Mr. Corbett spent a few days together
at the Albergo Sybilla Tivoli&mdash;where their sitting-room
faced the Temple of Vesta&mdash;so that he could superintend
there the printing of his “Sospiri.” The two
authors worked in the morning, and took walks in the
afternoon. The Diary records one expedition:</p>

<p class="pbq p1"><i>March 23.</i> After lunch J. C. and I caught the train
for Palombaria Marcellina meaning to ascend to Palombara:
but we mistook the highest and most isolated mountain
town, in the Sabines and after two hours of an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
exceedingly wild and rugged and sometimes almost impossible
mule-path, etc., we reached the wonderfully picturesque
and interesting San Polo dei Cavalieri. Bought
a reed pipe from a shepherd who was playing a Ranz des
Vaches among the slopes just below San Polo. The mediæval
castle in the middle of the narrow crooked picturesque
streets very fine. Had some wine from a comely
woman who lived in the lower part of the castle. Then
we made our way into the Sabines by Vicovaro, and
Castel Madama, and home late to Tivoli, very tired.</p>

<p>Certain tales told to him by the Italian woman, and the
picturesque town and its surroundings formed the basis
of the story “The Rape of the Sabines” which appeared
later in <i>The Pagan Review</i>. At the end of March he left
Rome, to his great regret; he joined me at Pisa and thence
we journeyed to Provence and stayed awhile at Arles,
whence he wrote to Mrs. Janvier:</p>

<p class="pbqr p1">30: 3: 91.</p>

<p class="pn"><span class="smcap">Gento Catarino</span>,</p>

<div class="pbq">
<p>You see I address you à la Provençale already! We
left Italy last week, and came to Provence. Marseilles,
I admit, seemed to me an unattractive place after Rome&mdash;and
indeed all of Provence we have seen as yet is somewhat
chill and barren after Italy. No doubt the charm
will grow. For one thing, Spring is very late here this
year....</p>

<p>Arles we like much. It is a quaint and pleasant little
town: and once I can get my mind free of those haunting
hill-towns of the Sabines and Albans I love so much&mdash;(is
there any hill range in the world to equal that
swing of the Apennines stretching beyond Rome eastward,
southward, and southwestward?)&mdash;I shall get to
love it too, no doubt. But oh, Italy, Italy! Not Rome:
though Rome has an infinite charm, even now when the
jerry-builder is fast ruining it: but “greater Rome,” the
Agro Romano! When I think of happy days at the Lake
of Nemi, high up in the Albans, of Albano, and L’Ariccia,
and Castel Gandolfo&mdash;of Tivoli, and the lonely Montecelli,
and S. Polo dei Cavalieri, and Castel Madama, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
Anticoli Corrado, etc., among the Sabines&mdash;of the ever
new, mysterious, fascinating Campagna, from the Maremma
on the North to the Pontine Marshes, my heart
is full of longing. I love North Italy too, all Umbria
and Tuscany: and to know Venice well is to have a secret
of perpetual joy: and yet, the Agro Romano! How I
wish you could have been there this winter and spring!
You will find something of my passion for it, and of that
still deeper longing and passion for the Beautiful, in my
“Sospiri di Roma,” which ought to reach you before the
end of April, or at any rate early in May. This very
day it is being finally printed off to the sound of the
Cascades of the Anio at Tivoli, in the Sabines&mdash;one of
which turns the machinery of the Socièta Laziale’s printing-works.
I do hope the book will appeal to you, as
there is so much of myself in it. No doubt it will be
too frankly impressionistic to suit some people, and its
unconventionality in form as well as in matter will
be a cause of offence here and there. You shall have one
of the earliest copies.</p>

<p>Yesterday was a fortunate day for arrival. It was a
great festa, and all the women were out in their refined
and picturesque costumes. The Amphitheatre was filled,
tier upon tier, and full of colour (particularly owing to
some three or four hundred Zouaves, grouped in threes
or fours every here and there) for the occasion of “a
grand Bull-Fight.” It was a brilliant and amusing scene,
though (fortunately) the “fight” was of the most tame
and harmless kind: much less dangerous even for the
most unwary of the not very daring Arlesians than a
walk across the remoter parts of the Campagna....</p></div>

<p class="p1">Letters from Mr. Meredith and Miss Blind, in acknowledgment
of the privately published volume of poems,
greatly pleased their author:</p>

<p class="pbqr p1"><span class="smcap">Box Hill</span>, April 15, 1891.</p>

<p class="pn"><span class="smcap">Dear Sharp</span>,</p>

<div class="pbq">
<p>I have sent a card to the Grosvenor Club. I have much
to say for the Sospiri, with some criticism. Impressionistic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
work where the heart is hot surpasses all but highest
verse. <i>When</i>, mind. It can be of that heat only at intervals.
In the ‘Wild Mare’ you have hit the mark. It is
an unrivalled piece.</p>

<p>But you have at times (I read it so) insisted on your
impressions. That is, you have put on your cap, sharpened
your pencil, and gone afield as the Impressionistic
poet. Come and hear more. I will give you a Crown
and a bit of the whip&mdash;the smallest bit.</p>

<p>Give my warm regards to your wife.</p></div>

<p class="pr6 reduct">Yours ever,</p>
<p class="pr4 reduct"><span class="smcap">George Meredith</span>.</p>


<p class="pbqr p1">May 18, 1891.</p>

<p class="pn"><span class="smcap">Dear Will</span>,</p>

<p class="pbq">I got the copy you sent me of <i>Sospiri di Roma</i>....
Your nature feeling is always so intense and genuine that
I would have liked my own mood to be more completely
in harmony with yours before writing to you about what
is evidently so spontaneous an outcome of your true self.
I should have wished to identify myself with this joy
in the beauty of the world which bubbles up fountainlike
from every one of these sparkling Roman transcripts,
why called “Sospiri” I hardly know. One envies you
the ebullient delight which must have flooded your veins
before you could write many of these verses, notably
“Fior di Primavera,” “Red Poppies,” and “The White
Peacock”: the effect of colour and movement produced
in these last two seems to be particularly happy, as also
the descriptions of the sea of roses in the first which
vividly recalled to me the prodigal wealth of blossom on
the Riviera. I thoroughly agree with what George Meredith
says of the sketch of “The Wild Mare,” the lines
of which seem as quiveringly alive as the high strung
nerves of these splendid creatures.</p>

<p class="pbq">“August Afternoon in Rome” is also an admirable
bit of impressionism and, if I remember, just that
effect&mdash;</p>

<p class="ppn6 p1">Far in the middle-flood, adrift, unoar’d,<br />
A narrow boat, swift-moving, black,<br />
Follows the flowing wave like a living thing.</p>

<p class="pbq p1">By and by if I should get to some “place of nestling
green for poets made” I hope to get more deeply into
the spirit of your book.</p>

<p class="pbq">Come to see me as soon as ever you and Lill can manage
it, either separately or together.</p>

<p class="pr6 reduct">Always yours,</p>
<p class="pr4 reduct"><span class="smcap">Mathilde Blind</span>.</p>

<p class="p1">Concerning certain criticisms on <i>Sospiri di Roma</i> he
wrote to Mrs. Janvier:</p>

<p class="pbqr p1">1st May, 1891.</p>

<p class="pbq">... Whether coming with praise or with blame and
cast me to the perdition of the unrighteous, the critics
all seem unable to take the true standpoint&mdash;namely,
that of the poet. What has he attempted, and how far
has he succeeded or failed? That is what should concern
them. It is no good to any one or to me to say that I am
a Pagan&mdash;that I am “an artist beyond doubt, but one
without heed to the cravings of the human heart: a worshipper
of the Beautiful, but without religion, without
an ethical message, with nothing but a vain cry for the
return, or it may be the advent, of an impossible ideal.”
Equally absurd to complain that in these “impressions”
I give no direct “blood and bones” for the mind to gnaw
at and worry over. Cannot they see that all I attempt
to do is to fashion anew something of the lovely vision
I have seen, and that I would as soon commit forgery
(as I told some one recently) as add an unnecessary line,
or “play” to this or that taste, this or that critical
opinion. The chief paper here in Scotland shakes its
head over “the nude sensuousness of ‘The Swimmer of
Nemi,’ ‘The Naked Rider,’ ‘The Bather,’ ‘Fior di Memoria,’
‘The Wild Mare’ (whose ‘fiery and almost savage
realism!’ it depreciates&mdash;tho’ this is the poem which
Meredith says is ‘bound to live’) and evidently thinks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
artists and poets who see beautiful things and try to
fashion them anew beautifully, should be stamped out,
or at any rate left severely alone....</p>

<p class="pbq">In work, creative work above all, is the sovereign
remedy for all that ill which no physician can cure: and
there is a joy in it which is unique and invaluable.</p>

<p class="p2">For a time, however, creative work had to be put aside.
The preparation of <i>The Life and Letters of Joseph
Severn</i> was a hard grind that lasted till mid-August. At
Whitby, on the 13th, according to his diary he “wrote
25 pp. digest of Severn’s novel and worked at other
things. Later I wrote the concluding pages, finishing the
book at 2 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span> I can hardly believe that this long delayed
task is now accomplished. But <i>at last</i> “Severn” is
done!”</p>

<p>The final revision occupied him till the 28th August,
and in order to finish it before we went abroad on the
27th he wrote “all morning till 1 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span>; again from 9 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span>
all night unbrokenly till 7 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span> Then read a little to
rest my brain and wrote four letters. Had a bath and
breakfast and felt all right.”</p>

<p>The 24th has the interesting entry: “Met old Charles
Severn at the Italian Restaurant near Portland Road
Station and had a long talk with him. He confirmed his
previous statement (end of September last year) about
Keats having written “The Ode to the Nightingale”
under “The Spaniards on Hampstead Heath.”</p>

<p>September found us in Stuttgart in order that my
husband should collaborate with the American novelist
Blanche Willis Howard. The first days were spent in
wandering about the lovely hillsides around the town,
which he described to Mrs. Janvier:</p>

<div class="pbq">
<p>... I know that you would revel in this glowing golden
heat, and in the beautiful vinelands of the South. Southern
Germany in the vintage season is something to remember<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
with joy all one’s life. Yesterday it seemed as
if the world above were one vast sea of deep blue wherever
a great glowing wave of light straight from the
heart of the sun was flowing joyously. I revel in this
summer gorgeousness, and drink in the hot breath of the
earth as though it were the breath of life. Words are
useless to depict the splendour of colour everywhere&mdash;the
glimmer of the golden-green of the vines, the immeasurable
sunfilled flowers, the masses of ripening fruit
of all kinds, the hues on the hill-slopes and in the valleys,
on the houses and the quaint little vineyard-cots with
their slanting red roofs. In the early afternoon I went
up through the orchards and vineyards on the shoulder
of the Hasenberg. It was a glory of colour. Nor have
I ever seen such a lovely purple bloom among the green
branches&mdash;like the sky of faerieland&mdash;as in the dark-plum
orchards. There was one heavily laden tree which was
superb in its massy richness of fruit: it was like a lovely
vision of those thunder-clouds which come and go in July
dawns. The bloom on the fruit was as though the west
wind had been unable to go further and had let its
velvety breath and wings fade away in a soft visible
death or sleep. The only sounds were from the myriad
bees and wasps and butterflies: some peasants singing
in the valley as they trimmed the vines: and the just
audible sussurrus of the wind among the highest pines
on the Hasenberg. There was the fragrance of a myriad
odours from fruit and flower and blossom and plant and
tree and fructifying soil&mdash;with below all that strange
smell as of the very body of the living breathing world.
The festival of colour was everywhere. As I passed a
cottar’s sloping bit of ground within his vineyards, I
saw some cabbages high up among some trailing beans,
which were of the purest and most delicate blue, lying
there like azure wafts from the morning sky. Altogether
I felt electrified in mind and body. The sunflood intoxicated
me. But the beauty of the world is always bracing&mdash;all
beauty is. I seemed to inhale it&mdash;to drink it in&mdash;to
absorb it at every pore&mdash;to become <i>it</i>&mdash;to become the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
heart and soul within it. And then in the midst of it
all came my old savage longing for a vagrant life: for
freedom from the bondage we have involved ourselves
in. I suppose I was a gipsy once&mdash;and before that “a
wild man o’ the woods.”</p>

<p>A terrific thunderstorm has broken since I wrote the
above. I have rarely if ever seen such continuous lightning.
As it cleared, I saw a remarkably beautiful sight.
In front of my window rose a low rainbow, and suddenly
from the right there was slung a bright steel-blue bolt,
seemingly hurled with intent right through the arch. The
next moment the rainbow collapsed in a ruin of fading
splendours....</p>

<p>I have had a very varied, and, to use a much abused
word, a very romantic life in its external as well as in
its internal aspects. Life is so unutterably precious that
I cannot but rejoice daily that I am alive: and yet I have
no fear of, or even regret at the thought of death....
There are many things far worse than death. When it
comes, it comes. But meanwhile we are alive. The
Death of the power to live is the only death to be
dreaded....</p></div>

<p class="p1">His Diary also testifies to his exultant mood:</p>

<p class="pbq p1"><i>Wednesday, 2:9:1891.</i>&mdash;Another glorious day. This
flood of sunshine is like new life: it <i>is</i> new life. I rejoice
in the heat and splendour of it. It seems to get into the
heart and brain, and it intoxicates with a strange kind
of rapture.... How intensely one lives sometimes, even
when there is little apparently to call forth quintessential
emotion. This afternoon was a holiday of the soul.
And yet how absolutely on such a day one realises the
savage in one. I suppose I was a gipsy once: a ‘wild
man’ before: a wilder beast of prey before that. We
all hark back strangely at times. To-day I seemed to
remember much.... What a year this has been for me:
the richest and most wonderful I have known. Were I
as superstitious as Polycrates I should surely sacrifice<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
some precious thing lest the vengeful gods should say
“Thou hast lived too fully: Come!...”</p>

<p class="p1">The following extracts from William’s Diary indicate
the method of the collaboration used by the two authors:</p>

<div class="pbq">
<p class="p1"><i>Sunday 6th. Sept. 1891.</i>&mdash;Blanche Willis Howard,
or rather, the Frau Hof-Arzt Von Teuffel, arrived last
night. She sent round word that she could conveniently
receive me in the afternoon, but as it was not to have
our first talk-over about our long projected joint novel,
Elizabeth came with me so as to make Frau Von T.’s
acquaintanceship.... She is a charming woman, and
I like her better than ever. As I am here to write a novel
in collaboration with her, and not to fall in love, I must
be on guard against my too susceptible self....</p>

<p><i>Monday 7th.</i>&mdash;At 3 o’clock I went to Frau Von Teuffel’s,
and stayed till 5.45. We had a long talk, and skirmished
admirably&mdash;sometimes “fluking” but ever and
again taking our man: in other words, we gained what
we were after, to some extent&mdash;indirectly as well as directly.
She agrees to my proposal that we call the book
<i>A Fellowe and His Wife</i>. The two chief personages are
to be Germans of rank, from the Rügen seaboard. I am
to be the “faire wife,” and have decided to live at Rome,
and to be a sculptor in ivory, and to have rooms in the
Palazzo Malaspina. Have not yet decided about my
name. My favourite German name is Hedwig, but Frau
Von T. objected that English and American readers
would pronounce it ‘Hed-wig.’ She suggested Edla: but
that doesn’t ‘fetch’ me. I think Freyda (or perhaps
Olga) would suit.</p>

<p><i>Tuesday, 8th.</i>&mdash;This morning I began our novel <i>A Fellowe
and His Wife</i>. I wrote some nine pages of MS.
being the whole of the first letter written by Freia (or
Ilse) from Rome.</p>

<p><i>Thursday, 10th.</i>&mdash;In the evening I went round to
Môrike Strasse. We had a long talk about the book and
its evolution, and ultimately decided to attempt the still
more difficult task of telling the whole story in the letters<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
of Odo and Ilse only. Of course this is much more difficult:
but if we can do it, so much the more credit to our
artistic skill and imaginative insight.... (It was also
decided that Frau v. Teuffel should write Odo’s letters,
and her collaborator, Ilse’s. In addition to the novel
W. S. dramatised the story in a five-act play.)</p>

<p><i>1st October, 1891.</i>&mdash;Wrote to-day the long first scene
of Act III. of <i>A Fellowe</i>. In afternoon E. and I went
out in the town. I bought Maurice Maeterlinck’s <i>La
Princesse Maleine</i> and <i>Les Aveugles</i>, and in the late
afternoon read right thro’ the latter and skimmed the
former. Some one has been writing about him recently
and comparing him to Webster. In method greatly, and
in manner, and even in conceptive imagination, he differs
from Webster: but he is his Cousin-German. It is certainly
hopelessly uncritical to say as Octave Mirbeau did
last year in a French paper or magazine that Maeterlinck
is another Shakespeare. He is not even remotely
Shakespearian. He is a writer of singular genius; and
I shall send for everything he has written. Reading
these things of his excited me to a high degree. It was
the electric touch I needed to produce my <i>Dramatic Interludes</i>
over which I have been brooding. I believe that
much of the imaginative writing of the future will be
in dramatic prose of a special kind....</p>

<p><i>Friday, 2nd.</i>&mdash;I went to bed last night haunted by my
story “The Summons.” To-day at 10.30 or nearer 11
I began to write it, and wrote without a break till 5.30,
by which time “A Northern Night,” as I now call it,
was entirely finished, ‘asides’ and all. Both there and
when I issue the <i>Dramatic Interludes</i> (five in all) I shall
send them forth under my anagram, H. P. Siwäarmill.
The volume will be a small one. The longest pieces will
be the “Northern Night,” and “The Experiment of
Melchior van Hoëk”: the others will be “The Confessor,”
“The Birth of a Soul” and “The Black Madonna.”</p>

<p><i>Saturday 3rd.</i>&mdash;... This late afternoon wrote the
Dramatic Study, “The Birth of a Soul.” Though not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
‘picturesque’ it touches a deeper note than “A Northern
Night,” and so is really the more impressive.</p>

<p><i>Tuesday, 6th.</i>&mdash;... P. S. After writing this Entry
for Tuesday, shortly before 12, I began to write the opening
particulars of Scene II. of Act IV., and went on till
I finished the whole scene, shortly before 2 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span></p>

<p><i>Wednesday, 7th.</i> Finished before 1 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span> my Play, <i>A
Fellowe</i>, by writing the longish Scene III. of Act IV.
Went out with Lill in the afternoon. The town all draped
in black for the death of the King of Saxony. Wrote to
Frank Harris (from here, as H. P. Siwäarmill) with
“The Birth of a Soul.” ...</p>

<p><i>Friday, 9th.</i>&mdash;In late evening thought out (but only so
far as leading lines and general drift) the drama “The
Gipsy-Christ.” (Being The Passion of Manuel van
Hoëk)....</p></div>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XII</h2>

<p class="pch">WALT WHITMAN</p>

<p class="pc"><i>The Pagan Review</i></p>

<p class="p2">The brilliant summer was followed by a damp and
foggy autumn. My husband’s depression increased with
the varying of the year. While I was on a visit to my
mother he wrote to me, after seeing me in the morning:</p>


<p class="pbqr p1">
<span class="smcap">Grosvenor Club</span>, Nov. 9th, 1891.</p>

<div class="pbq">
<p>“ ... I have been here all day and have enjoyed the
bodily rest, the inner quietude, and, latterly, a certain
mental uplifting. But at first I was deep down in the
blues. Anything like the appalling gloom between two
and three-thirty! I could scarcely read, or do anything
but watch it with a kind of fascinated horror. It is going
down to the grave indeed to be submerged in that hideous
pall.... As soon as I can make enough by fiction or
the drama to depend thereon we’ll leave this atmosphere
of fog and this environment of deadening, crushing, paralysing,
death-in-life respectability. Circumstances make
London thus for us: for me at least&mdash;for of course we
carry our true atmosphere in ourselves&mdash;and places and
towns are, in a general sense, mere accidents....</p>

<p>I have read to-day Edmond Schérer’s <i>Essais</i> on Eng.
Literature: very able though not brilliant&mdash;reread the
best portions of Jules Breton’s delightful autobiography,
which I liked so much last year ... all George Moore’s
New Novel, <i>Vain Fortune</i>.</p>

<p>I had also a pleasant hour or so dipping into Ben
Jonson, Beaumont and Fletcher, and other old dramatists:
refreshed my forgotten acquaintanceship with that
silly drama “Firmilian”: and, generally, enjoyed an irresponsible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
ramble thro’ whatever came to hand. I am
now all right again and send you this little breath, this
little ‘Sospiro di Guglielmo,’ to give you, if perchance
you need it, a tonic stimulus. No, you don’t need it!”</p></div>

<p class="p2">His health was so seriously affected by the fogs that
it became imperative that he should get into purer air
so he decided to fulfil his intention of going to New
York even though he had been forced to relinquish all
ideas of lecturing. There were various publishing matters
to attend to, and many friends to visit. In a letter
to Mrs. Janvier, announcing his projected visit, he tells
her of the particular work he had on hand:</p>

<p>“You will be the first to hear my new imaginative
work. Although in a new method, it is inherently more
akin to “Romantic Ballads” than to “Sospiri,” but it is
intense dramatic prose. There is one in particular I
wish to read to you&mdash;three weeks from now.” And he
adds, “Do you not long for the warm days&mdash;for the
beautiful living pulsing South? This fierce cold and
gloom is mentally benumbing.... Yes you are right:
there are few women and perhaps fewer men who have
the passion of Beauty&mdash;of the thrilling ecstasy of life.”</p>

<p>During his short stay in New York he was made the
welcome guest of Mr. and Mrs. Clarence Stedman; and
he delighted in this opportunity of again meeting his
good friends Mr. and Mrs. Richard Stoddart, Mr. Alden,
Mr. Howells, etc. But his chief interest was a memorable
visit to Walt Whitman, in whose fearless independent,
mental outlook, and joy in life, in whose vigorous individual
verse, he had found incentive and refreshment.
Armed with an introduction from Mr. Stedman he pilgrimaged
to Camden, New Jersey, on January 23rd, and
found the veteran poet in bed propped up with pillows,
very feeble, but bright-eyed and mentally alert. William
described the visit in a letter to me:</p>

<p>“During a memorable talk on the literature of the two
countries past and to come, the conversation turned upon
a vivid episode. ‘That was when you were young?’ I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
asked. The patriarchal old poet&mdash;who lay in his narrow
bed, with his white beard, white locks, and ashy-grey face
in vague relief, in the afternoon light, against the white
pillows and coverlet&mdash;looked at me before he answered,
with that half audacious, wholly winsome glance so characteristic
of him, ‘Now, just you tell me when you think
that was!’</p>

<p>“Then, with sudden energy, and without waiting for
a reply, he added, ‘Young? I’m as young now as I was
then! What’s this grey tangle’ (and as he spoke he gave
his straggling beard an impatient toss),’and this decrepit
old body got to do with that, eh? I never felt younger,
and I’m glad of it&mdash;against what’s coming along. <i>That’s</i>
the best way to shift camp, eh? That’s what I call
Youth!’”</p>

<p>When the younger man bade him farewell Whitman
gave him a message to take back with him across the
seas. “He said to me with halting breath: ‘William
Sharp when you go back to England, tell those friends of
whom you have been speaking, and all others whom you
may know and I do not that words fail me to express my
deep gratitude to them for sympathy and aid truly
enough beyond acknowledgment. Good-bye to you and
to them&mdash;the last greetings of a tired old poet.’”</p>

<p>The impression made on my husband, by the fearless
serene attitude of the great poet found expression in the
few lines that flashed into his mind, when on March 29th
he read in a London evening paper of the death of Walt
Whitman:</p>

<p class="pc1">IN MEMORIAM</p>

<p class="pph6 p1">He laughed at Life’s Sunset-Gates<br />
With vanishing breath,</p>
<p class="pph6">Glad soul, who went with the sun<br />
To the Sunrise of death.</p>

<p class="p1">While William was in New York Mr. Stedman was
asked by Mr. J. W. Young to approach his guest with a request
that he should “lecture” at Harvard upon a subject
of contemporary Literature. “Quite a number of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
Harvard men are anxious to see and hear Mr. Sharp if
he will consent to come to Cambridge.”</p>

<p>It was with genuine regret that, owing to his doctor’s
strict prohibition, William felt himself obliged to refuse
this flattering request. He had also been asked by Mr.
Palmer “the leading theatrical Boss in the States to sell
to him the rights of my play on ‘A Fellowe and his
Wife,’” a proposal which he declined.</p>

<p>On his return to England he wrote to Mr. Janvier:</p>

<p class="pn1">“<span class="smcap">Dear Old Man</span>,</p>

<div class="pbq">
<p>“I have read your stories (as I wrote the other day)
with particular pleasure, apart from personal associations.
You have a delicate and delightful touch that is
quite your own, and all in all I for my part fully endorse
what Mr. Howells wrote about you recently in Harpers’
and said as emphatically in private. So&mdash;amico caro&mdash;“go
in and win!”</p>

<p>I am settling down in London for a time, and am more
content to abide awhile now that the writing mood is at
last upon me again&mdash;and strong at that!</p>

<p>I have not yet put my hand to any of the commissioned
stories I must soon turn to&mdash;but tell <i>la sposa</i> that I have
finished my “Dramatic Vistas” (two or three of which
I read to her), and even venture to look with a certain
half-content upon the last of the series&mdash;“The Lute-Player”&mdash;which
has been haunting me steadily since last
October, but which I could not express aright till the
other day....”</p></div>


<p class="p1">The immediate outcome of his visit to America was the
publication, by Messrs. Chas. Webster &amp; Co., of his <i>Romantic
Ballads</i> and <i>Sospiri di Roma</i> in one volume entitled
<i>Flower O’ the Vine</i>. It was prefaced by a flattering
Introduction by Mr. Janvier, to whom the author
wrote in acknowledgment:</p>


<p class="pbqr p1"><span class="smcap">Paris</span>, 23d April, 1892.</p>

<p class="pbq">... Many thanks for your letter, my dear fellow, and
for the “Introduction,” which I have just read. I thank
you most heartily for what you say there, which seems<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
to me, moreover, if I may say so, at once generous, fittingly
reserved, and likely to win attention. You yourself
occupy such a high place in Letters oversea that such a
recommendation of my verse cannot but result to my
weal. I have been so deep in work and engagements, that
I have been unable to attend to any correspondence of
late&mdash;and have, I fear, behaved somewhat churlishly to
friends across the water, and particularly to my dear
friends at 27th Avenue. But now the <i>pressure</i> of work is
over for the moment: my London engagements or their
ghosts are vainly calling to me d’Outre-Manche: I am
keeping down my too cosmopolitan acquaintanceship in
Paris to the narrowest limit: and on and after the second
of May am going to reform and remain reformed. If you
don’t object to a little “roughing,” you would enjoy being
with me and <i>mes camarades</i> this coming week. We like
extremes, so after a week or so of the somewhat feverish
Bohemianism of literary and artistic Paris, we shall be
happy at our ‘gipsy’ encampment in the Forest of Fontainebleau
(at a remote and rarely-visited but lovely and
romantic spot between the Gorge de Franchard and the
Gorge d’Apremont). Spring is now here in all her
beauty: and there is a divine shimmer of green everywhere.
Paris itself is <i>en fête</i> with her vividly emerald
limes and sycamores, and the white and red spires of the
chestnuts must make the soul of the west wind that is
now blowing rejoice with gladness. The Seine itself is
of a paler green than usual, and is suggestive of those
apple-hued canals and conduits of Flanders and by the
‘dead cities’ of north-east Holland. I forget if you know
Paris&mdash;but there is one of its many fountains that has
an endless charm for me: that across the Seine, between
the Quai des Grands Augustins and the Bld. St. Germain&mdash;the
Fontaine St. Michel&mdash;I stood watching the foaming
surge and splash of it for some time yesterday, and
the pearl-grey and purple-hued doves that flew this way
and that through the sunlit spray. It brought, as it
always does, many memories of beloved Rome and Italy
back to me. I turned&mdash;and saw Paul Verlaine beside me:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
and I was in Paris again, the Paris of Paris, the Aspasia
of the cities of the World, the only city whom one loves
and worships (and is betrayed by) as a woman. Then
I went round to Leon Vanier’s, where there were many
of <i>les Jeunes</i>&mdash;Jean Moréas, Maurice Barrès, Cazals,
Renard, Eugène Holland, and others (including your
namesake, Janvier). To-night I <i>ought</i> to go to the
weekly gathering of a large number of <i>les Jeunes</i> at the
Café du Soleil d’Or, that favourite meeting place now of
<i>les décadents</i>, <i>les symbolistes</i>, and les everything else.
But I can’t withstand this flooding sunshine, and sweet
wind, and spraying of waters, and toss-toss and shimmer-shimmer
of blossoms and leaves; so I’ll probably be off.
<i>This</i> won’t be off if I don’t shut up in a double sense.</p>
<p class="pbq">My love to ‘Kathia’ and to you, dear fellow Pagans.</p>

<p class="pr6 reduct">Ever yours rejoicingly,</p>
<p class="pr4 reduct"><span class="smcap">William Sharp</span>.</p>

<p class="p1">Tell K. that when I have ‘reformed’ I’ll write to her.
Don’t let her be impertinent, and say that this promise
will be fulfilled <i>ad Græcas Kalendas</i>!</p>

<p>P. S. Here are my proposed ‘coming-movements.’</p>

<p>(1) Lill joins me in Paris about 10 days hence, and
remains to see the two Salons, etc.</p>

<p>(2) From the middle of May till the middle (14th) of
July we shall be in London.</p>

<p>(3) Then Lill goes with friends to Germany, to Bayreuth
(for Wagnerian joys) and I go afoot and aboat
among the lochs and isles and hills of the western Scottish
Highlands.</p>

<p>(4) We meet again in Stirling or Edinburgh, early in
August&mdash;and then, having purchased or hired a serviceable
if not a prancing steed, we go off for three weeks
vagabondage. The steed is for Lill and our small baggage
and a little tent. We’ll sometimes sleep out: sometimes
at inns, or in the fern in Highlander’s cottages.
Thereafter I shall again go off by myself to the extreme
west “where joy and melancholy are one, and where youth
and age are twins” as the Gaelic poet says.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span></p>

<p>(5) The rest of September visiting in Scotland.</p>

<p>(6) Part of October in London then (O Glad Tidings)</p>

<p>(7) Off for 6 months to the South: first to the Greek
side of Sicily: then to Rome (about Xmas) for the Spring.
Finally: a Poor-house in London.</p>

<p class="p2">The reply came swiftly:</p>

<p class="pbqr p1"><span class="smcap">New York</span>, 6: 5: 92.</p>

<p class="pn"><span class="smcap">My dear Sharp</span>,</p>

<p class="pbq">Your letter of April 3rd is like a stirring fresh wind.
The vigour of it is delightful, and a little surprising, considering
what you had been about. I will not cast stones
at you&mdash;and, if you ran on schedule time, you have been
reformed for four days. Your announcement that you
intend to stay reformed is fine in its way. What a noble
imagination you have! I am glad that you tolerate my
‘introduction.’ As Kate wrote you, I was very wretched&mdash;unluckily
for you&mdash;when it was written. I wish that
it were better in itself and more worthy of you. But the
milk is spilled. The book will look very well, I think....
Your programme for the ensuing year fills me with
longing. Even the London poorhouse at the end of it
don’t alarm me. Colonel Newcome was brought up in a
poorhouse&mdash;or a place of that nature; and, even without
such a precedent I should be willing to go to a poor-house
for a while after such a glorious year. Joy and good
luck attend you, my dear fellow, as you go upon your
gay way!...</p>

<p class="pr6 reduct">Always yours,</p>

<p class="p1"><i>A Fellowe and his Wife</i> had in the early spring been
published in America and England, and also in the
Tauchnitz Collection, and had a flattering reception in
both countries. It had been preceded in February by the
<i>Life and Letters of Joseph Severn</i> published by Messrs.
Sampson Low &amp; Co.</p>

<p>Among various articles written during the early summer
for the <i>Academy</i> were one on Philip Marston, and
one on Maeterlinck; and in the July number of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>

<p class="pn"><span class="smcap">My dear Sharp</span>,</p>

<p class="pbq">It did give me a great deal of pleasure to read the
article in the <i>Forum</i>, and what particularly struck me
was your power of grasping the characteristics of this

<p class="p1">Our delightful plans for the autumn were not carried
out; for, during a visit to the art critic, J. Stanley Little,
at Rudgwick, Sussex, my husband saw a little cottage
which attracted him and we decided to take it as a <i>pied-à-terre</i>.
Pending negotiations we stayed with Mr. and
Mrs. Caird at Northbrook, Micheldever, where W. S. began
to plan out the scheme of a new quarterly Review
that was “to be the expression of a keen pagan delight
in nature.” I quote from his Diary:</p>

<div class="pbq p1">
<p>“<i>June 2nd, 1892.</i> In early forenoon, after some pleasant
dawdling, began to write the Italian story, “The
Rape of the Sabines,” which I shall print in the first
instance in my projected <i>White Review</i> as by James
Marazion. After tea wrote about a page or so more of
story. Then went a walk up to One-Tree-Hill. Saw several
hares. The Cuckoo was calling till after 9 o’clock.
Noticed that the large white moths fluttered a long time
in one spot above the corn. Wild pigeons go to roost
sooner than rooks, apparently. Got back about 9.30, and
then finished “The Rape of the Sabines” (about 4,500
words).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span></p>

<p>“<i>Friday 3rd.</i> After breakfast went for a brisk walk
of over four miles. Then worked, slowly, till lunch, at
opening of “The Pagans” (afterwards to be called
“Good-Bye, my Fancy”). Then walked to the station
by the fields and back by the road (another 4 miles).
Then worked about an hour more on “The Pagans.”
Have done to-day, in all, from 1,200 to 1,500 words of it.
While walking in the afternoon thought out “The Oread”
and also the part of it which I shall use in the <i>White
Review</i> by Charles Verlayne.</p>

<p><i>Saty 4th.</i> Did rest of “The Pagans.” In afternoon
did first part of “The Oread.”</p>

<p><i>Sunday 5th.</i> Finished “Oread.”</p>

<p><i>Tuesday 7th.</i> Went down to Rudgwick, Sussex, by
appointment, and agreed to take the cottage on a 3-years’
lease.”</p></div>

<p class="p1">Regretfully the wanderings in the Highlands had to
be postponed although the projector of the Review went
for a time to Loch Goil with a friend and I to Bayreuth.
In August we settled in the little eight-roomed cottage,
near Rudgwick, with a little porch, an orchard and garden,
and small lawn with a chestnut tree in its midst.
We remained at Phenice Croft two years and took much
pleasure in the little green enclosure that was our own.
The views from it were not extensive. A stretch of
fields and trees lay in front of the house, and from the
side lawn we could see an old mill whose red brick roof
had been weathered to picturesque shades of green.
Phenice Croft stood at the edge of a little hamlet called
Buck’s Green, and across the road from our garden gate
stood the one shop flanked by a magnificent poplar tree,
that made a landmark however far we might wander.
It was a perpetual delight to us. William Sharp settled
down at once to the production of his quarterly to be
called, finally, <i>The Pagan Review</i>, edited by himself as
W. H. Brooks. As he had no contributors, for he realised
he would have to attract them, he himself wrote the whole
of the Contents under various pseudonyms. It was published<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
on August 15th, 1892; the cover bore the motto
“Sic transit gloria Grundi” and this list of contents:</p>

<p>The Editorial announced a promised article on “The
New Paganism” from the pen of H. P. Siwäarmill, but
it was never written.</p>

<p>As the <i>Foreword</i> gives an idea, not only of the Editor’s
project, but also of his mental attitude at that moment&mdash;a
sheer revelling in the beauty of objective life and nature,
while he rode for a brief time on the crest of the wave
of health and exuberant spirits that had come to him in
Italy after his long illness and convalescence&mdash;I reprint
it in its entirety.</p>

<div class="pbq">
<p class="p1">Editorial prefaces to new magazines generally lay great stress on the
effort of the directorate, and all concerned, to make the forthcoming periodical
popular.</p>

<p>We have no such expectation: not even, it may be added, any such
intention. We aim at thorough-going unpopularity: and there is every
reason to believe that, with the blessëd who expect little, we shall not be
disappointed.</p>

<p class="pc elarge">&#8258;</p>

<p class="pbq">In the first place, <i>The Pagan Review</i> is frankly pagan: pagan in sentiment,
pagan in convictions, pagan in outlook. This being so, it is a
magazine only for those who, with Mr. George Meredith, can exclaim in
all sincerity&mdash;</p>

<p class="ppq6 p1">“O sir, the truth, the truth! is’t in the skies,<br />
Or in the grass, or in this heart of ours&mdash;<br />
But O, the truth, the truth!...”&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span></p>

<p class="pbqn p1">and at the same time, and with the same author, are not unready to admit
that truth to life, external and internal, very often</p></div>

<p class="ppn14 p1">“... is not meat</p>
<p class="ppn6">For little people or for fools.”</p>

<p class="pbqn p1">To quote from Mr. Meredith once more:</p>

<p class="ppn14 p1">“... these things are life:</p>
<p class="ppn6">And life, they say, is worthy of the Muse.”</p>

<p class="pbqn p1">But we are well aware that this is just what “they” <i>don’t</i> say. “They,”
“the general public,” care very little about the “Muse” at all; and the
one thing they never advocate or wish is that the “Muse” should be so
indiscreet as to really withdraw from life the approved veils of Convention.</p>

<p class="pbq">Nevertheless, we believe that there is a by no means numerically
insignificant public to whom <i>The Pagan Review</i> may appeal; though our
paramount difficulty will be to reach those who, owing to various circumstances,
are out of the way of hearing aught concerning the most recent
developments in the world of letters.</p>

<p class="pc elarge">&#8258;</p>

<p class="pbq"><i>The Pagan Review</i> conveys, or is meant to convey, a good deal by its
title. The new paganism is a potent leaven in the yeast of the “younger
generation,” without as yet having gained due recognition, or even any
sufficiently apt and modern name, any scientific designation. The “new
paganism,” the “modern epicureanism,” and kindred appellations, are
more or less misleading. Yet, with most of us, there is a fairly definite
idea of what we signify thereby. The religion of our forefathers has not
only ceased for us personally, but is no longer in any vital and general
sense a sovereign power in the realm. It is still fruitful of vast good,
but it is none the less a power that was, rather than a power that is.
The ideals of our forefathers are not our ideals, except where the accidents
of time and change can work no havoc. A new epoch is about to
be inaugurated, is, indeed, in many respects, already begun; a new epoch
in civil law, in international comity, in what, vast and complex though the
issues be, may be called Human Economy. The long half-acknowledged,
half-denied duel between Man and Woman is to cease, neither through
the victory of hereditary overlordship nor the triumph of the far more
deft and subtle if less potent weapons of the weaker, but through a frank
recognition of copartnery. This new comradeship will be not less romantic,
less inspiring, less worthy of the chivalrous extremes of life and death,
than the old system of overlord and bondager, while it will open perspectives
of a new-rejoicing humanity, the most fleeting glimpses of which
now make the hearts of true men and women beat with gladness. Far
from wishing to disintegrate, degrade, abolish marriage, the “new paganism”
would fain see that sexual union become the flower of human life.
But, first, the rubbish must be cleared away; the anomalies must be
replaced by just inter-relations; the sacredness of the individual must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
be recognised; and women no longer have to look upon men as usurpers,
men no longer to regard women as spiritual foreigners.</p>

<p class="pc elarge">&#8258;</p>

<p class="pbq">These remarks, however, must not be taken too literally as indicative
of the literary aspects of <i>The Pagan Review</i>. Opinions are one thing,
the expression of them another, and the transformation or reincarnation
of them through indirect presentment another still.</p>

<p class="pbq">This magazine is to be a purely literary, not a philosophical, partisan,
or propagandist periodical. We are concerned here with the new presentment
of things rather than with the phenomena of change and growth
themselves. Our vocation, in a word, is to give artistic expression to the
artistic “inwardness” of the new paganism; and we voluntarily turn
aside here from such avocations as chronicling every ebb and flow of
thought, speculating upon every fresh surprising derelict upon the ocean
of man’s mind, or expounding well or ill the new ethic. If those who
sneer at the rallying cry, “Art for Art’s sake,” laugh at our efforts, we
are well content; for even the lungs of donkeys are strengthened by much
braying. If, on the other hand, those who, by vain pretensions and paradoxical
clamour, degrade Art by making her merely the more or less
seductive panoply of mental poverty and spiritual barrenness, care to do
a grievous wrong by openly and blatantly siding with us, we are still
content; for we recognise that spiritual byways and mental sewers relieve
the Commonwealth of much that is unseemly and might breed contagion.
<i>The Pagan Review</i>, in a word, is to be a mouthpiece&mdash;we are genuinely
modest enough to disavow the definite article&mdash;of the younger generation,
of the new pagan sentiment, rather, of the younger generation. In its
pages there will be found a free exposition of the myriad aspects of life,
in each instance as adequately as possible reflective of the mind and
literary temperament of the writer. The pass-phrase of the new paganism
is ours: <i>Sic transit gloria Grundi</i>. The supreme interest of Man is&mdash;Woman:
and the most profound and fascinating problem to Woman is,
Man. This being so, and quite unquestionably so with all the male and
female pagans of our acquaintance, it is natural that literature dominated
by the various forces of the sexual emotion should prevail. Yet, though
paramount in attraction, it is, after all, but one among the many motive
forces of life; so we will hope not to fall into the error of some of our
French confrères and be persistently and even supernaturally awake to
one functional activity and blind to the general life and interest of the
commonwealth of soul and body. It is <i>Life</i> that we preach, if perforce
we must be taken as preachers at all; Life to the full, in all its manifestations,
in its heights and depths, precious to the uttermost moment,
not to be bartered even when maimed and weary. For here, at any rate,
we are alive; and then, alas, after all,&mdash;</p>

<p class="ppn10 p1">“how few Junes</p>
<p class="ppn6">Will heat our pulses quicker...”</p>

<p class="pc elarge">&#8258;</p>

<p class="pbq">“Much cry for little wool,” some will exclaim. It may be so. Whenever
did a first number of a new magazine fulfil all its editor’s dreams<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
or even intentions? “Well, we must make the best of it, I suppose.
‘Tis nater, after all, and what pleases God,” as Mrs. Durbeyfield says in
“Tess of the Durbervilles.”</p>

<p class="pc elarge">&#8258;</p>

<p class="pbq">Have you read that charming <i>roman à quatre</i>, the <i>Croix de Berny</i>?
If so, you will recollect the following words of Edgar de Meilhan (<i>alias</i>
Théophile Gautier), which I (“I” standing for editor, and associates,
and pagans in general) now quote for the delectation of all readers, adversely
minded or generously inclined, or dubious as to our real intent&mdash;with
blithe hopes that they may be the happier therefor: “Frankly, I am
in earnest this time. Order me a dove-coloured vest, apple-green trousers,
a pouch, a crook; in short, the entire outfit of a Lignon Shepherd. I
shall have a lamb washed to complete the pastoral.”</p>

<p class="pc elarge">&#8258;</p>

<p class="pbq">This is “the lamb.”</p>

<p class="pbqr"><span class="smcap">The Editor.</span></p>

<p class="p1">The Review was well subscribed for, and many letters
came to the Editor and his secretary (myself) that
were a source of interest and amusement. Mr. Richard
Whiteing&mdash;who knew the secret of the Editorship
wrote: “I want to subscribe to <i>The Pagan Review</i> if you
will let me know to whom to send my <i>abonnement</i> for the
half year. I think, you know, you will have to put some
more clothes on before the end of the year. You are
certainly the liveliest and most independent little devil
of a review I ever saw in a first number.”</p>

<p>The Editor, however, swiftly realised that there could
be no continuance of the Review. Not only could he not
repeat such a <i>tour de force</i>, and he realised that for several
numbers he would have to provide the larger portion
of the material&mdash;but the one number had served its purpose,
as far as he was concerned for by means of it he
had exhausted a transition phase that had passed to give
way to the expression of his more permanent self.</p>

<p>To Thomas A. Janvier the Editor wrote:</p>

<p class="pbqr p1"><span class="smcap">Rudgwick, Sussex.</span></p>

<p class="pn"><span class="smcap">Dear Mr. Janvier</span>,</p>

<div class="pbq">
<p>For though we are strangers in a sense I seem to know
you well through our friend in common, Mr. William
Sharp!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span></p>

<p>I write to let you know that <i>The Pagan Review</i>
breathed its last a short time ago. Its end was singularly
tranquil, but was not unexpected. Your friend Mr.
Sharp consoles me by talking of a certain resurrection
for what he rudely calls “this corruptible”: if so the
P/R will speak a new and wiser tongue, appear in a
worthier guise, and put on immortality as a Quarterly.</p>

<p>In the circumstances, I return, with sincerest thanks,
the subscription you are so good as to send. Also the
memorial card of our late lamented friend&mdash;I mean the
P/R, not W. S. Talking of W. S., what an admirable
fellow he is! I take the greatest possible interest in his
career. I read your kind and generous estimate of him
in <i>Flower o’ the Vine</i> with much pleasure&mdash;and though
I cannot say that I hold quite so high a view of his poetic
powers as you do, I may say that perusal of your remarks
gave me as much pleasure as, I have good reason for knowing,
they gave to him. He and I have been ‘delighting’
over your admirably artistic and charming stories
in <i>Harper’s</i>. By the way, he’s settling down to a
serious ‘tussle.’ He has been “a bad boy” of late: but
about a week previous to the death of the Pagan/Review
he definitively reformed&mdash;on Sept. 11th in the early forenoon,
I believe. I hope earnestly he may be able to live
on the straight henceforth: but I regret to say that I see
signs of backsliding. Still, he may triumph; the spirit
is (occasionally) willing. But, apart from this, he is now
becoming jealous of such repute as he has won, and is
going to deserve it, and the hopes of friends like yourself.

<p class="pr6 reduct">You know you have ...</p>

<p class="pbq">Elizabeth A. Brooks was so pleased to receive your
letter.</p>


<p class="p1">One or two young writers sent in MS. contributions
and these of course he had to return. One came from
Mr. R. Murray Gilchrist with whom he had come into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
touch through his editorship of the Literary Chair in
<i>Young Folk’s Paper</i>. To him he wrote:</p>


<p class="pbqr p1"><span class="smcap">Rudgwick, Sussex</span>, 10: 92.</p>

<p class="pn"><span class="smcap">My dear Sir</span>,</p>

<p class="pbq">As it is almost certain that for unforeseen private reasons
serial publication of <i>The Pagan Review</i> will be held
over till sometime in 1893, I regret to have to return
your MS. to you. I have read <i>The Noble Courtesan</i> with
much interest. It has a quality of suggestiveness that
is rare, and I hope that it will be included in the forthcoming
volume to which you allude.... It seems to me
that the story would be improved by less&mdash;or more hidden&mdash;emphasis
on the mysterious aspect of the woman’s
nature. She is too much the “principle of Evil,” the
“modern Lilith.” If you do not use it, I might be able&mdash;with
some alterations of a minor kind&mdash;to use it in
the P/R when next Spring it reappears&mdash;if such is its
dubious fate.</p>

<p class="pr6 reduct">Yours very truly,</p>
<p class="pr4 reduct"><span class="smcap">W. H. Brooks</span>.</p>

<p class="pbq">P. S. It is possible that you may surmise&mdash;or that a
common friend may tell you&mdash;who the editor of the P/R
is: if so, may I ask you to be reticent on the matter.</p>


<p class="pr5 p1 reduct"><span class="smcap">Phenice Croft, Rudgwick</span>,</p>
<p class="pr4 reduct">22: 10: 92.</p>

<p class="pn"><span class="smcap">Dear Mr. Gilchrist</span>,</p>

<p>Although I do not wish the matter to go further I
do not mind so sympathetic and kindly a critic knowing
that “W. S.” and “W. H. Brooks” are synonymous.</p>

<p class="pbq">I read with pleasure your very friendly and cordial
article in <i>The Library</i>. By the way, it may interest you
to know that the “Rape of the Sabines” and&mdash;well, I’ll
not say what else!&mdash;is also by W. H. Brooks. But this,
no outsider knows.... <i>The Pagan Review</i> will be revived
next year, but probably as a Quarterly: and I look
to you as one of the younger men of notable talent to
give a helping hand with your pen.</p>

<p class="pbq">I suppose you come to London occasionally. I hope<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
when you are next south, you will come and give me
the pleasure of your personal acquaintance. I can offer
you a lovely country, country fare, a bed, and a cordial
welcome.</p>

<p class="pr6 reduct">Yours sincerely,</p>
<p class="pr4 reduct"><span class="smcap">William Sharp</span>.</p>

<p class="p1">Intimation had also to be sent to each subscriber; with
it was enclosed a card with the following inscription:</p>


<p class="pc1"><i>The Pagan Review.</i></p>

<p class="pbq">On the 15th September, still-born <i>The Pagan Review</i>.</p>

<p class="pbq">Regretted by none, save the affectionate parents and
a few forlorn friends, <i>The Pagan Review</i> has returned
to the void whence it came. The progenitors, more hopeful
than reasonable, look for an unglorious but robust
resurrection at some more fortunate date. “For of such
is the Kingdom of Paganism.”</p>

<p class="pbqr"><span class="smcap">W. H. Brooks.</span></p>

<p class="p1">And at the little cottage a solemn ceremony took place.
The Review was buried in a corner of the garden, with
ourselves, my sister-in-law Mary and Mr. Stanley Little
as mourners; a framed inscription was put to mark the
spot, and remained there until we left Rudgwick.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XIII</h2>

<p class="pch">ALGIERS</p>

<p class="pc"><i>Vistas</i></p>

<p class="p2">Many schemes were mentally cartooned for the autumn
and winter’s work; but all our plans were suddenly upset
by an unlooked for occurrence. While in Rome I had
had a severe attack of Roman fever; and I had never
quite recovered therefrom. The prolonged rains in the
hot autumn, the dampness of the clay soil on which lay
the hamlet of Buck’s Green, made me very ill again with
intermittent low fever. It was deemed imperative that
I should not spend the whole winter in England, but go
in search of a dry warm climate. But we had not the
necessary funds. So instead of devoting himself to his
dream-work, as he had hoped, my husband laid it temporarily
aside and settled himself to write between October
and Xmas, two exciting boys’ serial stories for
<i>Young Folk’s Paper</i>, and thus procured sufficient money
to enable us to cross to North Africa. “The Red Rider”
and “The Last of the Vikings” were crowded with startling
adventures. The weaving of sensational plots offered
no difficulties to him, but an enjoyment. He did not consider
the achievement of any real value, and did not
wish that particular kind of writing to be associated with
his name. His impressions of Algeria and Tunisia were
chronicled in a series of articles, such as “Cardinal
Lavigerie,” “The March of Rome,” “Rome in Africa,”
etc.; also in a series of letters to a friend from which I
select one or two:</p>

<p class="pbqr p1"><span class="smcap">Biskra</span>, 2d Feb., 1893.</p>

<div class="pbq">
<p>“Here we are in the Sahara at last! I find it quite
hopeless to attempt to give you any adequate idea of
the beauty and strangeness and the extraordinary fascination<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
of it all. The two days’ journey here was alone
worth coming to Africa for! We left Mustapha shortly
before dawn on Tuesday, and witnessed a lovely daybreak
as we descended the slopes to Agha: and there
we saw a superb sunrise streaming across the peaks and
ranges of the Djurdjura of Kabylia (the African Highlands)
and athwart the magnificent bay. The sea was
dead calm, and in parts still mirrored the moon and a
few stars: then suddenly one part of it became molten
gold, and that nearest us was muffled into purple-blue
wavelets by the dawn-wind. The sound of it washing
in, almost at the feet of the palms and aloes and Barbary-figtrees
was delicious. We had a long and delightful
day’s journey till sunset. Our route was through Grande
Kabylie, and the mountain scenery in particular was very
impressive. At many places we had a long stop: but
everywhere here railway-travelling is more like journeying
in a carriage, the rate of speed not being much more,
with ample facilities for seeing everything en route. The
Kabyles are the original inhabitants of Mauritanian
Africa&mdash;and both in language and appearance these Berbers
differ markedly from the Moors and the nomadic
Arabs. They are the hardiest and most industrious
though also the most untameable, of the native races.
They live in innumerable little villages scattered among
the mountains and valleys and plains of the Djurdjura
country.</p>

<p>“The sun sank over the uplands of Kabylia as we
mounted towards the ancient Roman outpost-city, Setif.
Setif stands about 3,500 ft. high: and crossing the plateaux
beyond it was like making an excursion through
Scotland in midwinter. Still, despite the snow on the
hills, and even along the roads of Setif itself, the cold
was not so severe as we expected.</p>

<p>“At four next morning we steamed slowly out of Setif
in full moonlight. An hour or so later dawn broke as
we passed a series of Arab encampments, and then came
another sunrise over a wild and desolate country. We
were now entirely in Mahommedan lands, for there are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
comparatively few Europeans south of the city of Constantine.</p>

<p>“At a place called El Guerrah we stopped for half an
hour for déjeuner. Soon thereafter we passed the Salt
Lakes, covered with wild-fowl, flamingoes, and other
birds. It was hereabouts that we first saw some camels.
Once more we mounted, and soon were high among the
Aurès mountains, perhaps the most delightful hill-region
of North Africa, with certainly the finest population,
Berbers like the Kabyles, but Berber-aristocrats&mdash;Berbers
refined by potent inherited strains from the Romans
of old. From Batna onwards the journey was an endless
delight. We came more and more into the East, and
soon grew wholly accustomed to Arab encampments,
herds of camels, Moors and Negroes coming in with
herds of bouricoes (little donkeys), wild black goats and
gaunt sheep, Nomads travelling southward or eastward,
picturesque Saharians or Spahis dashing past on grey
Arab horses, and semi-nude agriculturous Berbers. At
last the desert (the hill-desert) was entered. Here one
can realise the full significance of the French epithet
<i>tourmenté</i>: and, as one fares further, of the Biblical
phrase, the abomination of desolation. The whole country
seemed under the curse of barrenness: nothing but
gaunt ribbed mountains, gaunt ribbed hills, gaunt ribbed
sand-plains&mdash;this, or stony wastes of an arid desolation
beyond words. But though the country did not become
less awful in this respect, it grew wilder and stranger as
we neared Elkantara. I never saw scenery so <i>terrific</i>.
The entrance to the last Gorge was very exciting, for
beyond the narrow outlet lay the Sahara and all torrid
Africa! North of this last outpost of the colder zone
the date-palm refuses to flourish: and here, too, the
Saharan Arab will not linger: but in a quarter of a mile
one passes from this arid waste into African heat and
a superb oasis of date-palms. It is an indescribable sensation&mdash;that
of suddenly swinging through a narrow and
fantastic mountain-gorge, where all is gloom and terror,
and coming abruptly upon the full splendour of the sunswept<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
Sahara, with, in the immediate foreground, an immense
oasis of date-palms, all green and gold! The
vista&mdash;the vast perspectives&mdash;the glory of the sunflood!
From that moment, one can hardly restrain one’s excitement.
Very soon, however, we had fresh and unexpected
cause for excitement. The train slowly came to a stop,
and crowds of Arabs came up. The line had been destroyed
for more than half a mile&mdash;and we were told we
must walk across the intervening bit of desert, and ford
the Oued-Merjarla, till we reached the train sent to meet
us. We could see it in the distance&mdash;a black blotch in
the golden sunlight. One account was that some revolted
Arabs (and some of the outlying tribes are said to be
in a chronic state of sullen ill will) had done the mischief:
another, and more probable, that the hill-courses
had swollen the torrent of the Oued-Biskra, which had
rent asunder the desert and displaced the lines. The
Arabs carried our baggage, and we set forth across our
first Sahara-stretch. Despite the heat, the air was so
light and delicious that we enjoyed the experience immensely.
The river (or rather barren river-bed with a
pale-green torrent rushing through a deep cleft in the
sandy grit) was crossed on a kind of pontoon-bridge.
Soon after this the sun sank. We were in the middle of
a vast plain, almost surrounded by a series of low,
pointed hills, which became a deep purple. Far to the
right was a chott (or salt lake) and of lucent silver. For
the rest, all was orange-gold, yellow-gold, green-gold,
with, high over the desert, a vast effulgence of a marvellous
roseate flush. Then came the moment of scarlet
and rose, saffron, and deepening gold, and purple. In
the distance, underneath the dropping sparkle of the
Evening Star, we could discern the first palms of the oasis
of Biskra. There was nothing more to experience till arrival,
we thought: but just then we saw the full moon
rise out of the Eastern gloom. And what a moon it was!
Never did I see such a splendour of living gold. It
seemed incredibly large, and whatever it illumed became
strange and beautiful beyond words.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span></p>

<p>“Then a swift run past some ruined outlying mud-walls
and Arab tents, some groups of date-palms, a flashing
of many lights and clamour of Eastern tongues&mdash;and
we were in Biskra: El Biskra-ed-Nokkel, to give it its full
name (the City of the Palms)! We found pleasant quarters
in the semi-Moorish Hotel on Sahara. It has cool
corridors, with arched alcoves, on both sides, so that at
any time of day one may have coolness somewhere. In
the courtyard are seats where we can have coffee and
cigarettes under the palms, beside two dear little tame
gazelles....</p>

<p>“This morning we had many novel and delightful
glimpses of oriental life. In one narrow street the way
was blocked by camels lying or squatting right across
the road. As they are laden, they open their mouths,
snarlingly, and give vent to an extraordinary sound&mdash;part
roar, part grunt of expostulation....</p>

<p>“We came across a group of newly arrived camels
from the distant Oasis of Touggourt, laden with enormous
melons and pumpkins: and, hopping and running
about, two baby camels! They were extraordinary creatures,
and justified the Arab saying that the first camel
was the offspring of an ostrich and some now extinct kind
of monster.... Oh, this splendid flood of the sun!</p></div>

<p class="pbqr p1"><span class="smcap">Constantine</span>, 12th Feb., 1893.</p>

<p class="pbq">“It would be useless to attempt to give you any idea
of all we have seen since I last wrote. The impressions
are so numerous and so vivid until one attempts to seize
them: and then they merge in a labyrinth of memories.
I sent you a P/c from Sidi Okba&mdash;the memory of which
with its 5,000 swarming Arab population has been something
of a nightmare-recollection ever since. I can well
believe how the City of Constantine was considered one
of the seven wonders of the world. It is impossible to
conceive anything grander. Imagine a city hanging down
the sides of gorges nearly 1,000 feet in depth&mdash;and of the
most fantastic and imposing aspect. In these terrible
gorges, which have been fed with blood so often, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
storks and ravens seem like tiny sparrows as they fly
to and fro, and the blue rock-doves are simply wisps of
azure....</p>

<p class="pbq">Last night I had such a plunge into the Barbaric East
as I have never had, and may never have again. I cannot
describe, but will erelong tell you of those narrow
thronged streets, inexplicably intricate, fantastic, barbaric:
the Moorish cafés filled with motley Orientals&mdash;from
the turban’d Turk, the fez’d Jew, the wizard-like
Moor, to the Kabyl, the Soudanese, the desert Arab: the
strange haunts of the dancing girls: the terrible street
of the caged women&mdash;like wild beasts exposed for sale:
and the crowded dens of the Haschisch-eaters, with the
smoke and din of barbaric lutes, tam-tams, and nameless
instruments, and the strange wild haunting chanting of
the ecstatics and fanatics. I went at last where I saw
not a single European: and though at some risk, I met
with no active unpleasantness, save in one Haschisch
place, where by a sudden impulse some forty or fifty
Moors suddenly swung round, as the shriek of an Arab
fanatic, and with outstretched hands and arms cursed the
<i>Gaiour-kelb</i> (dog of an infidel!): and here I had to act
quickly and resolutely. Thereafter one of my reckless
fits came on, and I plunged right into the midst of the
whole extraordinary vision&mdash;for a kind of visionary Inferno
it seemed. From Haschisch-den to Haschisch-den I
wandered, from strange vaulted rooms of the gorgeously
jewelled and splendidly dressed prostitutes to the alcoves
where lay or sat or moved to and fro, behind iron bars,
the caged “beauties” whom none could reach save by
gold, and even then at risk; from there to the dark low
rooms or open pillared places where semi-nude dancing
girls moved to and fro to a wild barbaric music.... I
wandered to and fro in that bewildering Moorish maze,
till at last I could stand no more impressions. So I
found my way to the western ramparts, and looked out
upon the marvellous nocturnal landscape of mountain and
valley&mdash;and thought of all that Constantine had been&mdash;”</p>

<p class="pr4">Sunday, 19th Feb.</p>

<p class="pbq">“How strange it seems to write a line to London from
this London of 2,000 years ago! The sea breaks at my
feet, blue as a turquoise here, but, beyond, a sheet of marvellous
pale green, exquisite beyond words. To the right
are the inland waters where the Carthaginian galleys
found haven: above, to the right, was the temple of Baal:
right above, the temple of Tanit, the famous Astarte,
otherwise “The Abomination of the Sidonians.” Where
the Carthaginians lived in magnificent luxury, a little
out of the city itself, is now the Arab town of Sidi-ban-Saïd&mdash;like
a huge magnolia-bloom on the sunswept hillside.
There is nothing of the life of to-day visible, save
a white-robed Bedouin herding goats and camels, and,
on the sea, a few felucca-rigged fisherboats making for
distant Tunis by the Strait of Goletta. But there is life
and movement in the play of the wind among the grasses
and lentisks, in the hum of insects, in the whisper of
the warm earth, in the glow of the burning sunshine that
floods downward from a sky of glorious blue. <i>Carthage</i>&mdash;I
can hardly believe it. What <i>ivresse</i> of the mind the
word creates!”</p>

<p class="p1">The following letter was received shortly after our
return:</p>


<p class="pr5 p1 reduct"><span class="smcap">19 St. Mary Abbotts Terrace, W.</span>,</p>
<p class="pr4 reduct">7th March, 1893.</p>

<p class="pn"><span class="smcap">My dear Sharp</span>,</p>

<p class="pbq">I did not reply to your kind letter because I could not
divest myself of a certain suspicion of the postal arrangements
of the desert. I admit however there was
little warrant for misgiving since they are evidently civilised
enough to keep the natives well supplied with copies
of <i>The Island</i>. The thought of the studious Sheik painfully
spelling out that work with the help of his lexicon
is simply fascinating, and I have made up my mind to
read <i>The Arabian Nights</i> in the original by way of returning
the compliment. But if I talk any more about
myself I shall forget the immediate purpose of this letter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
which is to ask if you and Mrs. Sharp are back again;
and, if you are, how and when we may see you. I think
this was about the date of your promised return. We
shall all be delighted to see you and to hear about your
journey. You are more than ever Children of To-morrow
in my esteem, to be able not only to dare such trips but
to do them. When I read your letter I felt more than
ever a child of yesterday. Do write and give us a chance
of seeing you as soon as you can.</p>

<p class="pr6 reduct">Ever yours,</p>
<p class="pr4 reduct"><span class="smcap">R. Whiteing</span>.</p>


<p class="p1">Mr. Whiteing was one of the many friends who came
to our cottage for week-end visits in the ensuing spring
and summer. Among others whom we welcomed were
Mrs. Mona Caird, Miss Alice Corkran, Mr. George Cotterell,
Mr. and Mrs. Le Gallienne, the Honble Roden Noel,
Mr. Percy White, Dr. Byres Moir, Mr. and Mrs. Frank
Rinder, Mr. R. A. Streatfield, Mr. Laurence Binyon, my
brother R. Farquharson Sharp, and my sister-in-law
Mary, or Marik, who for many years acted as my husband’s
secretary and whose handwriting became familiar
to many correspondents who afterwards received letters
in handwriting from Fiona Macleod.</p>

<p class="p1">The Diary for December 1893 has the following entries:</p>

<div class="pbq">
<p class="p1">“We came back to a lovely English Spring, the finest
for a quarter of a century it is said. In May E. went to
Paris for the Salon: I went to Ventnor and Freshwater.
Wrote my long article for <i>Harpers’</i> on ‘The March of
Rome in North Africa.’</p>

<p>“At the end of July we went to Scotland: first for three
weeks to St. Andrew’s: then to Mrs. Glasford Bells’ at
Tirinie, near Aberfeldy in Perthshire: then to Corrie, in
Arran, for over a fortnight. Then E. visited friends, and
I went to Arrochar, etc. Then at my mother’s in Edinburgh:
and on my way south I stopped with R. Murray
Gilchrist at Eyam, in Derbyshire.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span></p>

<p>“In the autumn I arranged with Frank Murray of
Derby to publish <i>Vistas</i>. He could afford to give me only
£10, but in this instance money was a matter of little importance.
<i>Harpers’</i> gave me £50 for “The March of
Rome.” Knowles asked me to do “La Jeune Belgique”
for the September number which I did, and he commissioned
other work. On the head of it, too, Elkin Matthews
and John Lane have commissioned an extension of
the essay, and translation, for a volume to be issued in
the spring. In <i>Good Words</i>, “Froken Bergliot,” a short
story, was much liked: later, in December, “Love in a
Mist” (written June /92) still more so. African articles
commissioned by <i>Harpers</i>, <i>Atlantic Monthly</i>, <i>Art Journal</i>,
<i>Good Words</i>, and provisionally two others.</p>

<p>“Have written several stories and poems. Also done
the first part of a Celtic romance called <i>Pharais</i>, from
the word of Muireadach Albarmach, “Mithil domb triall
gu tigh na Pharais.” Have mentally cartooned <i>Nostalgia</i>
(a short one vol. romance) <i>The Woman of Thirty</i> (do.
novel), <i>Ivresse</i> (which I have proposed to Lady Colin
Campbell for our collaboration in preference to <i>Eve and
I</i>): “Passée,” “Hazard of Love”: a collection of short
stories, collectively called <i>The Comedy of Woman</i>: and
other volumes in romance, fiction, poetry, and drama.
Have done part of <i>Amor</i> (in Sonnets mostly as yet): and
the first part of “The Tower of Silence.” Have thought
out “Demogorgon”: also, projected a dramatic version
of <i>Anna Karenina</i>.</p>

<p>“Some time ago signed an agreement with Swan Sonnenschin
&amp; Co. to write a new life of Rossetti. It will
be out, I hope, next spring. Been getting slowly on
with it.</p>

<p>“Besides the bigger things I am thinking of, e. g. in
poetic drama “Demogorgon”: in fiction “The Lunes of
Youth” (Part 1 of the Trilogy of <i>The Londoners</i>), and
the <i>Women</i> series, have thought out <i>The Literary Ideal</i>
etc.&mdash;and also the philosophical “The Brotherhood of
Rest.” Besides, a number of short stories: some with a
definite end in view, that of coherent book-publication.
In the background are other works: e. g. <i>Darthûla</i>,
thought out nearly fully, which I would like to make my
<i>chef d’&oelig;uvre</i>. In all, I have actually on hand eight books,
and innumerable stories, articles, etc.</p></div>

<p class="p1"><i>Vistas</i> was published early in 1894 by Mr. Frank Murray
of Derby in “his Regent Series,” of which <i>Frangipani</i>
by R. Murray Gilchrist was the first number. The English
edition of <i>Vistas</i> is dedicated to <i>Madame Elspeth H.
Barzia</i>&mdash;an anagram on my name.</p>

<p>In the Dedication to H. W. Alden (author of “God
in His World”) in the American edition&mdash;which contains
an extra ‘<i>Interlude</i>’ entitled “The Whisperer”&mdash;the
intention of the book is thus explained:</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“You asked me what my aim was in those dramatic
interludes which, collectively, I call <i>Vistas</i>. I could not
well explain: nor can I do so now. All are vistas of the
inner life of the human soul, psychic episodes. One or
two are directly autopsychical, others are renderings of
dramatically conceived impressions of spiritual emotion:
to two or three no quotation could be more apt than that
of the Spanish novelist, Emilia Pardo Bazàn: ‘Enter
with me into the dark zone of the human soul.’ These
<i>Vistas</i> were written at intervals: the most intimate in
the spiritual sense, so long ago as the spring of 1886,
when during recovery from a long and nearly fatal illness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
‘Lilith’ came to me as a vision and was withheld
in words as soon as I could put pen to paper. Another
was written in Rome, after a vain effort to express adequately
in a different form the episode of death-menaced
and death-haunted love among those remote Scottish
wilds where so much of my childhood and boyhood and
early youth was spent.... I came upon for the first time
‘La Princesse Maleine’ and ‘L’Intruse.’</p>

<p class="pbq">“One or two of the <i>Vistas</i> were written in Stuttgart
in 1891, others a year or so later in London or elsewhere&mdash;all
in what is, in somewhat unscholarly fashion,
called the Maeterlinckian formula. Almost from the first
moment it seemed clear to me that the Belgian poet-dramatist
had introduced a new and vital literary form.
It was one that many had been seeking&mdash;stumblingly,
among them, the author of <i>Vistas</i>&mdash;but Maurice Maeterlinck
wrought the crude material into a form fit for
swift and dextrous use, at once subtle and simple. The
first which I wrote under this impulse is that entitled
‘Finis.’ The latest or latest but one (’The Whisperer,’
now added to this Edition) seems to me, if I may say so,
as distinctively individual as ‘The Passing of Lilith,’
and some, at least of my critics have noticed this in connection
with ‘The Lute Player.’ In all but its final form,
it embodies a conception that has been with me for many
years, ever since boyhood: a living actuality for me, at
last expressed, but so inadequately as to make me differ
from the distinguished critic who adjudged it the best
of the <i>Vistas</i>. To me it is the most obvious failure in
the book, though fundamentally, so near and real emotionally.”</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XIV</h2>

<p class="pch">THE PSEUDONYM</p>

<p class="pc"><i>Pharais</i></p>

<p class="p2">The summer of 1893 was hot and sunny: and we delighted
in our little garden with its miniature lawns, its
espalier fruit trees framing the vegetable garden, and
its juvenile but to us fascinating flower beds. Horsham,
our nearest town, was seven miles distant and the village
of Rudgwick lay a mile away up a steady ascent beyond
the station. William Sharp was happy once more to be
resident in the country, although the surroundings were
not a type of scenery that appealed to him. But, as he
wrote to a friend, it was not so much the place that he
liked “as what is in it conducive to that keen perturbation,
elation, excitement of mind, which is life worth
living.”</p>

<p>At Phenice Croft his imagination was in a perpetual
ferment. Out of the projected work that he had noted
in his diary, out of those subjects that lay in his mind
to germinate and mature, or to wither and be rejected,
grew one or two achievements; and in particular after
the completion of <i>Vistas</i>, a romance of the Isles, <i>Pharais</i>,
about which his friend Mr. Cotterell in acknowledging
a copy of these Dramatic Interludes, wrote to the
author:</p>

<p>“<i>Vistas</i> should mark a point in your career from
which you should go forward to greater things. I am
eager to see the Celtic romance.”</p>

<p>The quiet and leisure at Phenice Croft, the peace, the
“green life” around were unspeakably welcome to my
husband. Once again, he saw visions and dreamed
dreams; the psychic subjective side of his dual nature
predominated. He was in an acutely creative condition;
and, moreover he was passing from one phase of literary
work to another, deeper, more intimate, more permanent.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
So far, he had found no adequate method for the expression
of his “second self” though the way was led thereto
by <i>Sospiri di Roma</i> and <i>Vistas</i>.</p>

<p>The <i>Sospiri di Roma</i> was the turning point. Those
unrhymed poems of irregular meter are filled not only
with the passionate delight in life, with the sheer joy of
existence, but also with the ecstatic worship of beauty
that possessed him during those spring months we spent
in Rome, when he had cut himself adrift for the time
from the usual routine of our life, and touched a high
point of health and exuberant spirits. There, at last, he
had found the desired incentive towards a true expression
of himself, in the stimulus and sympathetic understanding
of the friend to whom he dedicated the first of
the books published under his pseudonym. This friendship
began in Rome and lasted throughout the remainder
of his life.</p>

<p>And though this newer phase of his work was at no
time the result of collaboration, as certain of his critics
have suggested, he was deeply conscious of his indebtedness
to this friend, for&mdash;as he stated to me in a letter
of instructions, written before he went to America in
1896, concerning his wishes in the event of his death&mdash;he
realised that it was “to her I owe my development
as ‘Fiona Macleod’ though, in a sense of course, that
began long before I knew her, and indeed while I was
still a child,” and that, as he believed, “without her there
would have been no ‘Fiona Macleod.’”</p>

<p>Because of her beauty, her strong sense of life and
of the joy of life; because of her keen intuitions and
mental alertness, her personality stood for him as a symbol
of the heroic women of Greek and Celtic days, a symbol
that, as he expressed it, unlocked new doors in his
mind and put him “in touch with ancestral memories”
of his race. So, for a time, he stilled the critical, intellectual
mood of William Sharp to give play to the development
of this new found expression of subtler emotions,
towards which he had been moving with all the ardour
of his nature.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span></p>

<p>From then till the end of his life there was a continual
play of the two forces in him, or of the two sides of his
nature: of the intellectually observant, reasoning mind&mdash;the
actor, and of the intuitively observant, spiritual
mind&mdash;the dreamer, which differentiated more and more
one from the other, and required different conditions,
different environment, different stimuli, until he seemed
to be two personalities in one. It was a development
which, as it proceeded, produced a tremendous strain on
his physical and mental resources; and at one time between
1897-8 threatened him with a complete nervous
collapse.</p>

<p>And there was for a time distinct opposition between
these two natures which made it extremely difficult for
him to adjust his life, for the two conditions which were
equally imperative in their demands upon him. His
preference, naturally, was for the intimate creative work
which he knew grew out of his inner self; though the
exigencies of life, his dependence on his pen for his livelihood&mdash;and,
moreover the keen active interest ‘William
Sharp’ took in all the movements of the day, literary and
political, at home and abroad&mdash;required of him a great
amount of applied study and work.</p>

<p>During those two years at Phenice Croft, to which he
always looked back with deep thankfulness, he was the
dreamer&mdash;he was testing his new powers, living his new
life, and delighting in the opportunity for psychic experimentation.
And for such experimentation the place
seemed to him to be peculiarly suited. To me it seemed
“uncanny,” and to have a haunted atmosphere&mdash;created
unquestionably by him&mdash;that I found difficult to live in,
unless the sun was shining. This uncanny effect was felt
by more than one friend; by Mr. Murray Gilchrist, for
instance, whose impressions were described by his host
in one of the short “Tragic Landscapes.”</p>

<p><i>Pharais</i> was the first of the books written and published
under the pseudonym of “Fiona Macleod.” The
first reference to it is in the afore noted diary: “Have
also done the first part of a Celtic romance called<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
<i>Pharais</i>.” The next is in a letter written to Mrs. Janvier
from St. Andrews, on 12th August, 1893, before the
author had decided on the use of a pseudonym:</p>

<div class="pbq">
<p class="p1">“ ... The white flowers you speak of are the moondaisies,
are they not?&mdash;what we call moonflowers in the
west of Scotland and ox-eye daisies in England, and marguerites
in France?... It is very strange that you
should write about them to me just as I was working out
a scene in a strange Celtic tale I am writing, called <i>Pharais</i>,
wherein the weird charm and terror of a night of
tragic significance is brought home to the reader (or I
hope so) by a stretch of dew-wet moonflowers glimmering
white through the mirk of a dusk laden with sea mists.
Though this actual scene was written a year or two ago&mdash;and
one or two others of the first part of <i>Pharais</i>&mdash;I am
going to re-write it, your letter having brought some
subtle inspiration with it. <i>Pharais</i> is a foil to the other
long story I am working at. While <i>it</i> is full of Celtic
romance and dream and the glamour of the mysterious,
the other is a comedy of errors&mdash;somewhat in the nature,
so far, of “A Fellowe and His Wife” (I mean as to
style). In both, at least the plot, the central action, the
germinal <i>motif</i>, is original: though I for one lay little
stress on extraneous originality in comparison with that
inner originality of individual life.... I have other
work on the many occupied easels in the studio of my
mind: but of nothing of this need I speak at present.
Of minor things, the only one of any importance is a
long article on a subject wherein I am (I suppose) the
only specialist among English men of letters&mdash;the Belgian
literary Renaissance since 1880. It is entitled “La
Jeune Belgique,” and will appear in (I understand) the
September number of <i>The Nineteenth Century</i>....”</p>

<p>“ ... We must each ‘gang our ain gait.’ I’m singularly
indifferent to what other people think in any matter
where I feel strongly myself. Perhaps it is for this
reason that I am rarely ‘put out’ by adverse criticism or
opinion&mdash;except on technical shortcomings. I do a lot of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
my own work here lying out on the sand-dunes by the
sea. Yesterday I had a strange experience. I was writing
in pencil in <i>Pharais</i> of death by the sea&mdash;and almost
at my feet a drowned corpse was washed in by the tide
and the slackening urgency of the previous night’s gale.
The body proves to be that of a man from the opposite
Forfar coast. It had been five days in the water, and
death had played havoc with his dignity of lifeless manhood.
I learned later that his companion had been found
three days ago, tide-drifted in the estuary of the Tay.
It was only a bit of flotsam, in a sense, but that poor
derelict so sullenly surrendered of the sea changed for
me, for a time, the aspect of those blithe waters I love so
well. In the evening I walked along the same sands.
The sea purred like a gigantic tigress, with a whisper of
peace and rest and an infinite sweet melancholy. What a
sepulchral fraud....</p>

<p>“Life seems to move, now high and serene and incredibly
swift as an albatross cleaving the upper air, now as
a flood hurled across rocks and chasms and quicksands.
But it is all life&mdash;even the strangely still and quiet backwaters,
even, indeed, the same healthful commonplace
lagoons where one havens so gladly often....”</p></div>

<p class="p2">Three months later, he wrote to Mr. Richard Stoddart
and proposed for serial publication in <i>Lippincotts</i>
a romance to be called <i>Nostalgia</i>&mdash;which was never written.
In the same letter he speaks of “another story,
<i>Pharais</i>,” which he describes as “written deeply in the
Celtic spirit and from the Celtic standpoint.” Neither
suggestion was accepted; and the author decided to issue
<i>Pharais</i> as soon as possible in book form, and not under
his own name.</p>

<p>When in the following year the book was published the
author, forgetting that he had ever written Mrs. Janvier
about it, sent a copy of it to her, and said merely that it
was a book in which he was interested. Whereupon she
wrote and asked if the book were not his own, and he
replied:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span></p>

<p class="pbq p1">“ ... Yes, <i>Pharais is mine</i>. It is a book out of my
heart, out of the core of my heart. I wrote it with the
pen dipped in the very ichor of my life. It has reached
people more than I dreamt of as likely. In Scotland especially
it has stirred and created a new movement.
Here, men like George Meredith, Grant Allen, H. D.
Traill, and Theodore Watts hailed it as a ‘work of
genius.’ Ignored in some quarters, abused in others, and
unheeded by the ‘general reader,’ it has yet had a reception
that has made me deeply glad. It is the beginning
of my true work. Only one or two know I am ‘Fiona
Macleod.’ Let you and my dear T.A.J. preserve my
secret. I trust you.</p>

<p class="pbq">“You will find more of me in <i>Pharais</i> than in anything
I have written. Let me add that you will find <i>The
Mountain Lovers</i>, at which I am now writing when I can,
more elemental still, while simpler.... By blood I am
part Celt, and partly so by upbringing, by Spirit wholly
so.... One day I will tell you of some of the strange old
mysteries of earlier days I have part learned, part divined,
and other things of the spirit. You can understand
how I cannot do my true work, in this accursed
London.”</p>

<p class="p1">A little later he wrote:</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“ ... I resent too close identification with the so-called
Celtic renaissance. If my work is to depend solely on its
Gaelic connection, then let it go, as go it must. My work
must be beautiful in itself&mdash;Beauty is a Queen and must
be served as a Queen.</p>

<p class="pbq">“ ... You have asked me once or twice about F. M.,
why I took her name: and how and when she came to
write <i>Pharais</i>. It is too complex to tell you just now....
The name was born naturally: (of course I had associations
with the name Macleod.) It, Fiona, is very rare
now. Most Highlanders would tell you it was extinct&mdash;even
as the diminutive of Fionaghal (Flora). But it is
not. It is an old Celtic name (meaning “a fair maid”)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
still occasionally to be found. I know a little girl, the
daughter of a Highland clergyman, who is called Fiona.
<i>All</i> my work is so intimately wrought with my own experiences
that I cannot tell you about <i>Pharais</i>, etc., without
telling you my whole life.”</p>

<p class="p1">As a matter of fact <i>Pharais</i> was not the first written
expression of the new work. It was preceded by a short
story entitled “The Last Fantasy of James Achanna”
that in the autumn of 1893 was sent to <i>The Scots Observer</i>.
It was declined by Mr. Henley who, however,
wrote a word of genuine encouragement. He accepted
Mr. Henley’s decision, and the story was never reprinted
in its first form. It was re-written several times; it was
included in <i>The Dominion of Dreams</i> as “The Archer.”
During the writing of <i>Pharais</i> the author began to realise
how much the feminine element dominated in the
book, that it grew out of the subjective, or feminine side
of his nature. He, therefore, decided to issue the book
under the name of <i>Fiona Macleod</i>, that “flashed ready
made” into his mind. Mrs. Janvier wrote later and
asked why he, a man, chose to send forth good work
under the signature of a woman. He answered:</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“ ... I can write out of my heart in a way I could not
do as William Sharp, and indeed I could not do so if I
were the woman Fiona Macleod is supposed to be, unless
veiled in scrupulous anonymity....</p>

<p class="pbq">“This rapt sense of oneness with nature, this <i>cosmic
ecstasy</i> and elation, this wayfaring along the extreme
verges of the common world, all this is so wrought
up with the romance of life that I could not bring myself
to expression by my outer self, insistent and tyrannical
as that need is.... My truest self, the self who is
below all other selves, and my most intimate life and joys
and sufferings, thoughts, emotions and dreams, <i>must</i> find
expression, yet I cannot save in this hidden way.”</p>

<p class="p1">He was wont to say “Should the secret be found out,
Fiona dies.” Later in the year he wrote: “Sometimes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
I am tempted to believe I am half a woman, and so
far saved as I am by the hazard of chance from what a
woman can be made to suffer if one let the light of the
common day illuminate the avenues and vistas of her
heart....”</p>

<p class="p1">A copy of <i>Vistas</i> and one of <i>Pharais</i> were sent to
George Meredith, who wrote in acknowledgment to the
author:</p>

<p class="pbqr p1"><span class="smcap">Box Hill</span>, July 5, 1894.</p>

<p class="pn"><span class="smcap">Dear Mr. Sharp</span>,</p>

<div class="pbq">
<p>‘Vistas’ gave me pleasure, and a high lift at times.
There is the breath in it. Only beware of a hurried
habit of mind that comes of addiction to Impressionist effects.
They engender that mood in readers ultimately.</p>

<p>‘Pharais’ is in many respects most admirable&mdash;pure
Celtic salt. I should have written to thank the writer
before this: but I am at work up to an hour of the dinner
bell day by day at the finish of this novel&mdash;and not too
happy about it.</p>

<p>Will you beg Miss Macleod’s excuse of me for the moment?
Her book is one to fly sure to the mark. I hope
you will come to me in September, when I shall be back
there.</p>

<p class="p1">The following letter to Mr. Grant Allen is one of the
earliest that were signed with the pseudonym:</p>

<p class="pbqr p1">1894.</p>

<p class="pn"><span class="smcap">Grant Allen, Esq.</span>:<br />
<span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,</p>

<p class="pbq">I have only now ascertained that you are in England.
I was informed that you were in the south of France.
Some short time ago I asked Mr. Frank Murray of
Derby to forward to you a copy of my just published
romance <i>Pharais</i>. I now write to ask if you will accept<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
it as a slight token of homage from the youngest and
latest of Celtic writers to the most brilliant champion of
the Celtic genius now living. I do not, however, send it
by way of inveigling you to write about it, much as any
word of yours would mean to me both in service and
honour: but primarily because of your deep and vivid
sympathy not only with nature but with the Celtic
vision of nature&mdash;and, also, let me add, because of the
many delightful hours I have enjoyed with your writings.</p>

<p class="pr6 reduct">Faithfully yours,</p>
<p class="pr4 reduct"><span class="smcap">Fiona Macleod</span>.</p>

<p class="p1">Mr. Grant Allen replied:</p>

<p class="pbqr p1"><span class="smcap">The Croft, Hindhead.</span></p>

<p class="pn"><span class="smcap">Dear Madam</span>,</p>

<p class="pbq">I thank you for your book, and still more for your
charming and too flattering letter. <i>Pharais</i> strikes me as
a beautiful and poetical piece of work. It is instinct with
the dreamy Celtic genius, and seems to come to us
straight from the Isles of the Dead. That shadowy Ossianic
spirit, as of your misty straits and your floating
islands, reminds me exactly of the outlook from the western
mountains over the summer-blue belted sea as I
saw it once on an August morning at Oban. Too shadowy,
sometimes, and too purely poetical, I fear, for your
Saxon readers. But the opening sentences are beautiful,
and the nature-studies and the sense of colour throughout
are charming. Now, after so much praise, will you
forgive a few questions and a word of criticism? You
are, I take it, a young writer, and so an older hand may
give you a hint or two. Don’t another time interlard
your English with Gaelic. Even a confirmed Celtomaniac
like myself finds it a trifle distracting. Don’t say “the
English,” and “the Gaelic.” Give a little more story to
less pure poetry. Of course I recognise that your work
is an idyll, not a novel, a cameo, not a woodcut; but even
so, it seems to me a trifle too dreamy. Forgive this
frankness, and remember that success still lies in the lap
of the Saxon. Also that we Celts have our besetting sins,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
and that perfection in literature lies in avoiding excess
in any direction, even that of one’s own best qualities.
Now a question or two&mdash;because you interest me. How in
English letters would you write <i>Pharais</i> phonetically, or
as near it as our clumsy southern lips can compass? (I
have not “the Gaelic,” and my Celtic blood is half Irish,
half Breton.) And how “Fiona?” Is it something like
Feena? And are you Miss or Mrs.? And do you live in
Edinburgh? If ever you come south, we hope you will
let us know; for my wife read your book before I did,
and interested me in it by sketching the story for me.
Now see how long a letter I have written unto you, going
the Apostle one better, with my own left hand: only the
busiest man in England could have found time to do it.</p>

<p class="pr6 reduct">Faithfully yours,</p>
<p class="pr4 reduct"><span class="smcap">Grant Allen</span>.</p>

<p class="p1">Questions as to the identity of the author were already
‘in the air’; “F. M’s” answer to Mr. Allen shows that
the author felt ‘her’ security menaced:</p>

<p class="pr5 p1 reduct"><span class="smcap">Kilcreggan, Argyll</span>,</p>
<p class="pr4 reduct">1894.</p>

<p class="pn"><span class="smcap">Dear Mr. Grant Allen,</span></p>

<div class="pbq">
<p>You are very kind indeed&mdash;both to write to me, you
who are so busy, and to promise to do anything you can
for my book. It is very good of you. Truly, it is the
busiest people who find time to do what is impossible to
idle folk....</p>

<p>I have just had a letter of deeply gratifying praise and
recognition from Mr. George Meredith, who says he finds
my work ‘rare and distinctive.’ He writes one phrase,
memorable as coming from him: “Be sure that I am
among those readers of yours whom you kindle.”</p>

<p>Permit me, dear Mr. Allen, to make a small request
of you. If you are really going to be so kind as to say
anything about my book I trust you will not hint playfully
at any other authorship having suggested itself to
you&mdash;or, indeed, at my name being a pseudonym. And,
sure, it will be for pleasure to me if you will be as scrupulous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
with Mr. Meredith or anyone else in private, as in
public, if chance should ever bring my insignificant self
into any chit-chat.</p>

<p>My name is really Fiona (i. e. Fionnaghal&mdash;of which
it is the diminutive: as Maggie, Nellie, or Dair are diminutives
of Margaret, Helen, or Alasdair).</p>

<p>I hope to have the great pleasure of seeing Mrs. Allen
and yourself when (as is probable) I come south in the
late autumn or sometime in November.</p></div>

<p class="pr6 reduct">Sincerely and gratefully yours,</p>
<p class="pr4 reduct"><span class="smcap">Fiona Macleod</span>.</p>

<p class="pbqr p1"><span class="smcap">St. Andrews, 1894.</span></p>

<p class="pn"><span class="smcap">Dear Mr. Grant Allen</span>,</p>

<div class="pbq">
<p>How generous you are! If it were not for fear of
what you say about my Gaelic phrases I should quote one
to the effect that the wild bees that make the beautiful
thoughts in your brain also leave their honey on your
lips.</p>

<p>Your <i>Westminster</i> review has given me keen pleasure&mdash;and
for everything in it, and for all the kind interest
behind it, I thank you cordially.</p>

<p>What you say about the survival of folklore as a living
heritage is absolutely true&mdash;<i>how</i> true perhaps few
know, except those who have lived among the Gaels, of
their blood, and speaking the ancient language. The
Celtic paganism lies profound and potent still beneath
the fugitive drift of Christianity and Civilisation, as the
deep sea beneath the coming and going of the tides. No
one can understand the islander and remote Alban Gael
who ignores or is oblivious of the potent pagan and indeed
elementally barbaric forces behind all exterior appearances.
(This will be more clearly shown in my next
published book, a vol. of ten Celtic tales and episodes&mdash;with,
I suppose, a more wide and varied outlook on
life, tho’ narrow at that!&mdash;than either of its predecessors.)
But excuse this rambling. Your review is all the
more welcome to me as it comes to me during a visit to
friends at St. Andrews, and to me, alas, the East Coast<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
of Scotland is as foreign and remote in all respects as
though it were Jutland or Finland....</p>

<p>Again with thanks, dear Mr. Allen,</p></div>

<p class="pr6 reduct">Most sincerely yours,</p>
<p class="pr4 reduct"><span class="smcap">Fiona Macleod</span>.</p>

<p class="pbq">P. S. In his letter Mr. Sharp says (writing to me in
his delightful shaky Gaelic) that ‘both Grant and Nellie
Allen are <i>clach-chreadhain</i>.’ It took me some time to
understand the compliment. <i>Clach-chreadh</i> means
‘stone of clay’&mdash;i. e. <i>a Brick</i>!</p>

<p class="p2">That Mr. Grant Allen was half persuaded as to the
identity of the author is shown in the following invitation:</p>

<p class="pr5 p1 reduct"><span class="smcap">The Croft, Hindhead</span>,</p>
<p class="pr4 reduct">July 12, 1894.</p>

<p class="pn"><span class="smcap">My dear Sharp</span>,</p>

<div class="pbq">
<p>Kindly excuse foolscap, I am out of note-paper, and
on this remote hilltop can’t easily get any. As for the
type-writing, I am reduced to that altogether, through
writer’s cramp, which makes my right hand useless even
for this machine, which I am compelled to work with my
left hand only.&mdash;As to <i>Pharais</i>, I will confess I read it
with some doubt as to whether it was not your own production;
and after I had written my letter to Miss Macleod,
I took it to my wife and said, “Now, if this is
William Sharp, what a laugh and a crow he will have over
me!” Le Gallienne, who is stopping with us, was sure
it was yours; but on second thoughts, I felt certain, in
spite of great likeness of style, there was a feminine
touch in it, and sent on my letter. All the same, however,
I was not quite satisfied you were not taking us in, especially
as your book with Blanche Willis Howard had
shown one how womanly a tone you could adopt when
it suited you; and I shan’t feel absolutely at rest on the
subject till I have seen the “beautiful lassie” in person.
If she turns out to be W. S. in disguise, I shall owe you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
a bad one for it; for I felt my letter had just that nameless
tinge of emotion one uses towards a woman, and a
beginner, but which would be sadly out of place with an
old hand like yourself, who has already won his spurs in
the field of letters.</p>

<p>We shall be glad to make your cousin’s acquaintance
(supposing her to exist) in October. It will afford us
the opportunity we have long desired of asking you and
Mrs. Sharp to come and see us in our moorland cottage,
all up among the heather. Indeed, we have had it in our
minds all summer to invite you&mdash;you are of those whom
one would wish to know more intimately. I have long
felt that the Children of To-morrow ought to segregate
somehow from the children of to-day, and live more in
a world of their own society.</p>

<p>With united kindest regards, and solemn threats of
vengeance if you are still perpetrating an elaborate hoax
against me,</p></div>

<p class="pr8 reduct">I am ever</p>
<p class="pr6 reduct">Yours very sincerely,</p>
<p class="pr4 reduct"><span class="smcap">Grant Allen</span>.</p>

<p class="p1">Unfortunately, there was an imperative reason for
bringing our residence at Rudgwick to a close. The
damp, autumnal days in the little cottage on its clay soil,
and the fatigue of constantly going up and down to town
in order to do the work of the Art critic for the <i>Glasgow
Herald</i>&mdash;which I for some time had undertaken&mdash;proved
too severe a strain on me, and I found that in the winter
months I could not remain at Phenice Croft without being
seriously ill. So with great reluctance we decided
to give it up at midsummer. I was anxious that we
should seek for another cottage, on a main line of railway,
and on sandy soil; but my husband feared to make
another experiment and preferred that we should make
our headquarters in London once again, and that he
should go into the country whenever the mood necessitated.
But his regret was deep. Phenice Croft had seen
the birth of Fiona Macleod; he had lived there with an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
intensity of inner life beyond anything he had ever experienced.
He knew that life in town would create difficulties
for him, yet it seemed the wisest compromise to
make. Our difficulty of choice was mainly one of ways
and means; a considerable part of the ordinary work
was in my hands, and I found it difficult to do it satisfactorily
away from London. He expressed his regret in a
letter to Mr. Murray Gilchrist:</p>

<p class="pr5 p1 reduct"><span class="smcap">Phenice Croft</span>,</p>
<p class="pr4 reduct">27th March, 1894.</p>

<p class="pn"><span class="smcap">My dear Gilchrist</span>,</p>

<div class="pbq">
<p>You would have heard from me before this&mdash;but I
have been too unwell. Besides, I have had extreme pressure
of matters requiring every possible moment I could
give. My wife’s health, too, has long been troubling me:
and we have just decided that (greatly to my disappointment)
we must return to Hampstead to live. Personally,
I regret the return to town (or half town) more than I
can say: but the matter is one of paramount importance,
so there is nothing else to be done. We leave at midsummer.
As for me, one of my wander-fits has come upon
me: the Spring-madness has got into the blood: the sight
of green hedgerows and budding leaves and the blue
smoke rising here and there in the woodlands has
wrought some chemic <i>furor</i> in my brain. Before the
week is out I hope to be in Normandy&mdash;and after a day
or two by the sea at Dieppe, and then at beautiful and
romantic Rouen, to get to the green lanes and open
places, and tramp ‘towards the sun.’ I’ll send you a
line from somewhere, if you care to hear.</p>

<p>And now, enough about myself. I have often meant to
write to you in detail about your <i>Stone-Dragon</i>....</p>

<p>I believe in you, camerado mio, but you must take a
firm grip of the reins; in a word, be the driver, not the
driven. I think you ought to be able to write a really romantic
romance. I hope <i>The Labyrinth</i> may be this
book: if not, then it will pave the way. But I think you
should see more of actual life: and not dwell so continually<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
in an atmosphere charged with your own imaginings&mdash;the
glamour through which you see life in the main
at present.</p>

<p>Probably you are wise to spend the greater part of
each year as you do: but part of the year should be
spent otherwise&mdash;say in a town like London, or Paris, or
in tramping through alien lands, France or Belgium,
Scandinavia, or Germany, or Italy, or Spain: if not, in
Scotland, or Ireland, or upon our Isles, or remote counties.</p>

<p>It is because I believe in you that I urge you to beware
of your own conventions. Take your pen and paper, a
satchel, and go forth with a light heart. The gods will
guide <i>you</i> to strange things, and strange things to you.
You ought to <i>see</i> more, to <i>feel</i> more, to <i>know</i> more, at
first hand. Be not afraid of excess. “The road of excess
leads to the palace of wisdom,” says Blake, and truly....
Meanwhile let me send you a word of sunshine. To be
alive and young and in health, is a boon so inestimable
that you ought to fall on your knees among your moorland
heather and thank the gods. Dejection is a demon
to be ruled. We cannot always resist his tyranny, but
we can always refuse to become bondagers to his usurpation.
Look upon him as an Afreet to be exorcised with a
cross of red-hot iron. He is a coward weakling, after all:
take him by the tail and swing him across the moor or
down the valley. Swing up into your best.</p>

<p>Be brave, strong, self-reliant. Then you live.</p></div>

<p class="p1">We took a small flat in South Hampstead (Rutland
House, Greencroft Gardens) that stood high enough for
us to see, on clear days, the line of the Surrey hills from
the windows, and to give us a fine stretch of sky above
the chimney pots.</p>

<p>The night before leaving Phenice Croft, a lovely still
evening, he wrote the little poem,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span></p>

<p class="pch">THE WHITE PEACE</p>

<p class="pph6 p1">It lies not on the sunlit hill<br />
Nor in the sunlit gleam</p>
<p class="pph6">Nor ever in any falling wave<br />
Nor ever in running stream&mdash;</p>

<p class="pph6 p1">But sometimes in the soul of man<br />
Slow moving through his pain</p>
<p class="pph6">The moonlight of a perfect peace<br />
Floods heart and brain.</p>

<p class="p1">and sent it to me in a letter (for I had gone to town in
advance of him), and told me:</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“Before I left I took up a handful of grassy turf, and
kissed it three times, and then threw it to the four quarters&mdash;so
that the Beauty of the Earth might be seen by
me wherever I went and that no beauty I had seen or
known there should be forgotten. Then I kissed the
chestnut tree on the side lawn where I have seen and
heard so much: from the springing of the dream flowers,
to the surge of the sea in <i>Pharais</i>.”</p>

<p class="p1">Thence he went to Scotland and wrote to me from Kilcreggan,
where he was staying with his mother and sisters
till I could join him:</p>

<div class="pbq">
<p class="p1">“I told you about Whistlefield? how it, and all the
moorland parts about here just now, is simply a boggy
sop, to say nothing of the railway works. I hope we’ll
have fine weather in Iona: it will be lovely there if we
go....</p>

<p>(By the way Mr. Traill had a gratifying notice of
<i>Pharais</i> in the <i>Graphic</i> a week or two ago.)</p>

<p>I have made friends here with a Celtic Islesman from
Iona who is settled here: and have learned some more
legends and customs etc. from him&mdash;also got a copy of an
ancient MS. map of Iona with all its fields, divisions,
bays, capes, isles, etc. He says my pronunciation of
Gaelic is not only surprisingly good, but is distinctively
that of the Isles.</p>

<p>I have learned the rune also of the reading of the
spirit. The ‘influence’ itself seems to me purely hypnotic.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
I was out with this man McC&mdash;&mdash; on Saty.
night last in a gale, in a small two-sailed wherry. We
flew before the squalls like a wild horse, and it was glorious
with the shriek of the wind, the heave and plunge of
the boat, and the washing of the water over the gunwales.
Twice ‘the black wind’ came down upon us out
of the hills, and we were nearly driven under water.
He kept chanting and calling a wild sea-rune, about a
water-demon of the isles, till I thought I saw it leaping
from wave to wave after us. Strangely, he is a different
man the moment others are present. He won’t speak a
word of Gaelic, nor be ‘Celtic’ in any way, nor even
give the word as to what will be doing in the isles at this
time or any other. This, however, I have noticed often:
and all I have ever learned has been in intimacy and
privily and more or less casually. On Sunday and Monday
he avoided me, and would scarce speak: having given
himself away and shown his Celtic side&mdash;a thing now
more than ever foreign to the Celtic nature, which has
become passionately reticent. But a few words in Gaelic,
and a private talk, put all right again. Last night I got
the rune of the ‘Knitting of the Knots’ and some information
about the <i>Dalt</i> and the <i>Cho-Alt</i> about which I was
not clear. He has seen the Light of the Dead, and his
mother saw (before her marriage, and before she even
saw the man himself) her husband crossing a dark stream
followed by his four unborn children, and two in his
arms whom afterwards she bore still-born....”</p></div>

<p class="p1">To me the summer was memorable because of my first
visit to Iona. While there he wrote part of <i>The Sin-Eater</i>,
and its prefatory dedication to George Meredith,
and projected some of the St. Columba tales; he renewed
impressions of his earlier days on the sacred isle, and
stored new experiences which he afterwards embodied in
his long essay on Iona published in <i>The Divine Adventure</i>
volume.</p>

<p>From that Isle of Dreams “Fiona” wrote to Mrs.
Tynan-Hinkson:</p>

<p class="pr5 p1 reduct"><span class="smcap">Isle of Iona</span>,</p>
<p class="pr4 reduct">September, 1894.</p>

<p class="pn"><span class="smcap">Dear Mrs. Hinkson</span>,</p>

<p class="pbq">I am, in summer and autumn, so much of a wanderer
through the Isles and Western Highlands that letters
sometimes are long in reaching me. But your kind note
(and enclosure) has duly followed me from Edinburgh
to Loch Goil in eastern Argyll and thence deviously here.
It will be a great pleasure to me to read what you have
to say in the <i>Illus. London News</i> or elsewhere, and I
thank you. I wish you could be here. Familiar with your
poetry as I am, I know how you would rejoice not only
in the Iona that is the holy Icolmkill but also in the Iona
that is Ithona, the ancient Celtic Isle of the Druids.
There is a beauty here that no other place has, so unique
is it. Of course it does not appeal to all. The Sound of
Iona divides the Island from the wild Ross of Mull by
no more than a mile of water; and it is on this eastern
side that the village and the ancient Cathedral and ruined
Nunnery etc. stand. Here it is as peaceful as, on the
west side, it is wild and grand. I read your letter last
night, at sunset, while I was lying on the Cnoc-an-Angeal,
the hillock on the west where the angel appeared to St.
Columba. To the north lay the dim features of the
Outer Hebrides: to the west an unbroken wilderness of
waves till they fall against Labrador: to the south,
though invisible, the coastline of Ireland. There was
no sound, save the deep hollow voice of the sea, and a
strange reverberation in a hollow cave underground. It
was a very beautiful sight to see the day wane across the
ocean, and then to move slowly homeward through the
gloaming, and linger awhile by the Street of the Dead
near the ruined Abbey of Columba. But these Isles are
so dear to me that I think everyone must feel alike!</p>

<p class="p1">In November came a letter from Mr. Stedman:</p>

<p class="pr4 reduct"><span class="smcap">New York.</span></p>

<p class="pn"><span class="smcap">My dearest Friend beyond Seas</span>,</p>

<div class="pbq">
<p>For this in truth you now are. An older poet and
comrade than you once held that place in my thoughts,
but Time and Work have somehow laid the sword between
us&mdash;and neither of us is to blame. I never so well
obeyed Emerson’s advice to recruit our friendship (as
we grow older) as when I won, I scarcely know how or
why, your unswerving and ever increasing affection. In
truth, again, it has been of the greatest service to me,
during the most trying portion of my life&mdash;the period in
which you have given me so much warmth and air&mdash;and
never has it been of more worth than now you might
well think otherwise.</p>

<p>My birthday began for me with the “Sharp Number”
of <i>The Chapbook</i>. I don’t know what fact of it gave me
the more pleasure (it came at a time when I had a-plenty
to worry me)&mdash;the beautiful autographic tribute to myself
or the honour justly paid to my dear Esquire-at-arms,
whose superb portrait is the envy of our less fortunate
Yankee-torydons. The last five years have placed
you so well to the front, on both sides of the Atlantic, that
I can receive no more satisfying tributes than those
which you have given me before the world. I feel, too,
that it is only during these years that you have come to
your full literary strength, there is nothing which the
author of your “Ballads” and of “Vistas” cannot do.</p>

<p>It is a noteworthy fact which you will be glad to hear,
that your letter lay by my plate, when I came down to
breakfast on the morning of October the eight! The
stars in their courses must be in league with you....</p>

<p>Mrs. Stedman sends her love, and says that your portrait
is that of a man grown handsomer, and, she trusts,
more discreet and ascetic! The month and this letter are
now ending with midnight.</p></div>

<p class="pr6 reduct">Ever affectionately yours</p>
<p class="pr4 reduct"><span class="smcap">Edmund C. Stedman</span>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1">The Chap-book was a little semi-monthly issue published
by Messrs. Stone and Kimball, Chicago. No. 9,
the “William Sharp” number, appeared on the 15th of
September, three days after that author’s birthday. It
contained the reproduction of an autograph signed poem,
by William Sharp “To Edmund Clarence Stedman in
Birthday Greeting 8th October”; an appreciation of
William Sharp’s Poems by Bliss Carmen; “The Birth of
a Soul” one of the Dramatic Interludes afterwards included
in <i>Vistas</i>, and a portrait of the Author.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the paramount interest to the author
of the “F. M.” expression of himself as, “W. S.” he was
not idle. After a visit to Mr. Murray Gilchrist in the
latter’s home on the Derbyshire moors, W. S. wrote his
story “The Gypsy Christ,” founded on a tradition which
he had learned from his gipsy friends, and set in a weird
moorland surroundings. In <i>Harper’s</i> there appeared a
description of the night-wanderers on the Thames’ embankment,
pathetic frequenters of “The Hotel of the
Beautiful Star.” The July number of <i>The Portfolio</i> consisted
of a monograph by him on “Fair Women in Painting
and Poetry” (afterwards published in bookform by
Messrs. Seeley) which he, at first, intended to dedicate
to Mr. George Meredith. His ‘second thought’ was approved
of by the novelist, who wrote his acknowledgment:</p>

<p>“You do an elusive bit of work with skill. It seems to
me, that the dedication was wisely omitted. Thousands
of curdling Saxons are surly almost to the snarl at the
talk about ‘woman.’ Next to the Anarchist, we are
hated.”</p>

<p>The month of July was saddened by the death of
our intimate and valued friend Walter Pater; upon that
friend and his work William Sharp wrote a long appreciation
which appeared in <i>The Atlantic Monthly</i>. Another
death, at the year-end, caused him great regret,
that of Christina Rossetti, whom he had held in deep
regard. He felt, as he wrote to her surviving brother:
“One of the rarest and sweetest of English singers is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
silent now. 1882 and 1894 were evil years for English
poetry.” Later he wrote a careful study of her verse
for <i>The Atlantic Monthly.</i></p>

<p>As a Christmas card that year he gave me a little book
of old wood-cut illustrations, reproduced and printed on
Iona. On the inside of the cover he wrote what he held
to be his creed. It is this:</p>

<p class="pch"><span class="smcap">Credo</span></p>

<p>“The Universe is eternally, omnipresently and continuously
filled with the breath of God.</p>

<p>“Every breath of God creates a new convolution in the
brain of Nature: and with every moment of change in
the brain of Nature, new loveliness is wrought upon the
earth.</p>

<p>“Every breath of God creates a new convolution in
the brain of the Human Spirit, and with every moment
of change in the brain of the Human Spirit, new hopes,
aspirations, dreams, are wrought within the Soul of the
Living.</p>

<p>“And there is no Evil anywhere in the Light of this
creative Breath: but only, everywhere, a redeeming from
Evil, a winning towards Good.”</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XV</h2>

<p class="pch">THE MOUNTAIN LOVERS</p>

<p class="pc"><i>The Sin-Eater</i></p>

<p class="p2">It was soon evident that the noise and confused magnetism
of the great City weighed disastrously on William
Sharp. At the New Year, 1895, he wrote to a friend:</p>

<p>“London I do not like, though I feel its magnetic
charm, or sorcery. I suffer here. The gloom, the streets,
the obtrusion and intrusion of people, all conspire
against thought, dream, true living. It is a vast reservoir
of all the evils of civilised life with a climate which makes
me inclined to believe that Dante came here instead of to
Hades.”</p>

<p>The strain of the two kinds of work he was attempting
to do, the immediate pressure of the imaginative work
became unbearable, “the call of the sea,” imperative.</p>

<p>As he has related in “Earth, Fire and Water”: “It
was all important for me not to leave in January, and in
one way I was not ill-pleased for it was a wild winter.
But one night I awoke hearing a rushing sound in the
street, the sound of water. I would have thought no
more of it had I not recognised the troubled sound of
the tide, and the sucking and lapsing of the flow in muddy
hollows. I rose and looked out. It was moonlight, and
there was no water. When after sleepless hours I rose
in the grey morning I heard the splash of waves, I could
not write or read and at last I could not rest. On the
afternoon of that day the waves dashed up against the
house.”</p>

<p>An incident showed me that his malaise was curable by
one method only. A telegram had come for him that
morning, and I took it to his study. I could get no answer.
I knocked, louder, then louder,&mdash;at last he opened<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
the door with a curiously dazed look in his face. I explained.
He answered “Ah, I could not hear you for the
sound of the waves!” It was the first indication to me,
in words, of what troubled him.</p>

<p>That evening he started for Glasgow en route for Arran,
where I knew he would find peace.</p>

<p>“The following morning we (for a kinswoman was
with me) stood on the Greenock pier waiting for the
Hebridean steamer and before long were landed on an
island, almost the nearest we could reach that I loved so
well.... That night, with the sea breaking less than a
score of yards from where I lay, I slept, though for three
nights I had not been able to sleep. When I woke the
trouble was gone.”</p>

<p>There is a curious point in his telling of this episode.
Although the essay is written over the signature of “Fiona
Macleod” and belongs to that particular phase of
work, nevertheless it is obviously “William Sharp” who
<i>tells</i> the story, for the “we” who stood on the pier at
Greenock is himself in his dual capacity; “his kinswoman”
is his other self.</p>

<p>He wrote to me on reaching his destination:</p>

<p class="pr5 p1 reduct"><span class="smcap">Corrie, Isle of Arran</span>,</p>
<p class="pr4 reduct">20: 2: 1895.</p>

<div class="pbq">
<p>“You will have had my telegram of my safe arrival
here. There was no snow to speak of along the road
from Brodick (for no steamer comes here)&mdash;so I had
neither to ride nor sail as threatened: indeed, owing to
the keen frost (which has made the snow like powder)
there is none on the mountains except in the hollows,
though the summits and flanks are crystal white with
a thin veil of frozen snow.</p>

<p>It was a most glorious sail from Ardrossan. The sea
was a sheet of blue and purple washed with gold. Arran
rose above all like a dream of beauty. I was the
sole passenger in the steamer, for the whole island!
What made the drive of six miles more beautiful than
ever was the extraordinary fantastic beauty of the frozen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
waterfalls and burns caught as it were in the leap.
Sometimes these immense icicles hung straight and long,
like a Druid’s beard: sometimes in wrought sheets of
gold, or magic columns and spaces of crystal.</p>

<p>Sweet it was to smell the pine and the heather and
bracken, and the salt weed upon the shore. The touch
of dream was upon everything, from the silent hills to the
brooding herons by the shore.</p>

<p>After a cup of tea, I wandered up the heights behind.
In these vast solitudes peace and joy came hand in hand
to meet me. The extreme loneliness, especially when I
was out of sight of the sea at last, and could hear no
more the calling of the tide, and only the sough of the
wind, was like balm. Ah, those eloquent silences: the
deep pain-joy of utter isolation: the shadowy glooms and
darkness and mystery of night-fall among the mountains.</p>

<p>In that exquisite solitude I felt a deep exaltation grow.
The flowing of the air of the hills laved the parched
shores of my heart....</p></div>

<p class="p1">There is something of a strange excitement in the
knowledge that two people are here: so intimate and yet
so far-off. For it is with me as though Fiona were asleep
in another room. I catch myself listening for her step
sometimes, for the sudden opening of a door. It is unawaredly
that she whispers to me. I am eager to see
what she will do&mdash;particularly in <i>The Mountain Lovers</i>.
It seems passing strange to be here with her alone at
last....”</p>

<p><i>The Mountain Lovers</i> was published in the summer of
1895 by Mr. John Lane. A copy of it was sent to Mr.
George Meredith with the following letter:</p>


<p class="pr5 p1 reduct"><span class="smcap">9 Upper Coltbridge Terrace</span>,</p>
<p class="pr4 reduct"><span class="smcap">Murrayfield</span>.</p>

<p class="pn"><span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,</p>

<p class="pbq">Will you gratify one of your most loyal readers by the
acceptance of the accompanying book? Nothing helped</p>

<p class="pbq">me so much, or gave me so much enduring pleasure, as
your generous message to me about my first book, <i>Pharais</i>,
which you sent through my cousin, Mr. William
Sharp.</p>

<p class="pbq">Naturally, I was eager it should appeal to you&mdash;not
only because I have long taken keener delight in your
writings than in those of any living author, but also
because you are Prince of Celtland....</p>

<p class="pbq">I hope you will be able to read, and perhaps care for,
<i>The Mountain Lovers</i>. It is not a story of the Isles, like
<i>Pharais</i>, but of the remote hill-country in the far northwest.
I know how busy you are: so do not consider it
necessary to acknowledge either the book or this letter.
Still, if some happy spirit move you, I need not say that
even the briefest line from you would be a deep pleasure
to</p>

<p class="pr6 reduct">Yours, with gratitude and homage,</p>
<p class="pr4 reduct"><span class="smcap">Fiona Macleod</span>.</p>

<p class="p1">Acknowledgment came swiftly:</p>

<p class="pn"><span class="smcap">Dear Madam</span>,</p>

<p class="pbq">If I could have written on any matter out of my press
of work when I received your <i>Pharais</i>, there would have
been no delay with me to thank you for such a gift to
our literature. This book on the “Mountains” promises
as richly. Whether it touches equally deep, I cannot yet
say. I find the same thrill in it, as of the bard on the
three-stringed harp, and the wild western colour over sea
and isles; true spirit of the mountains. How rare this is!
I do not know it elsewhere. Be sure that I am among
those readers of yours whom you kindle. I could write
more, but I have not recovered from the malady of the
<i>degoût de la plume</i>, consequent on excess&mdash;and I pray
that it may never fall on you. For though it is wisdom
at my age to cease to write, it is not well to be taught to
cease by distaste. That is a giving of oneself to the
enemy. I have to be what I am, and I disclose it to win<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
your pardon for my inexpressiveness when I am warmly
sensible of a generous compliment.</p>

<p class="pr6 reduct">I am, Yours most faithful</p>
<p class="pr6 reduct"><span class="smcap">George Meredith</span>.</p>

<p class="p1">It was in 1895 that the Omar Khayyam Club under the
Presidentship of Mr. Edward Clodd, who was an old personal
friend of Mr. Meredith, elected to hold its summer
dinner at the Burford Bridge Hotel. Mr. Thomas Hardy,
Mr. Watts-Dunton, Mr. George Gissing and William
Sharp were among the guests. Mr. Clodd knew that it
would be difficult to persuade Mr. Meredith to be present
at the dinner. Nevertheless he lured him to the Hotel,
and when coffee was served, (I quote from a contemporary
account) “the beautiful face of the great novelist
appeared within the doorway, and he was welcomed with
enthusiasm by all present. The president extended to
Mr. Meredith the right hand of fellowship on behalf of
the Club, in a charming and eloquent speech not devoid
of pathos. Mr. Meredith in his reply declared that Mr.
Clodd was the most amiable of Chairmen but the most
dastardly of deceivers. Never before, he added, had he
been on his legs to make a speech in public, now before
he knew it he was bustled over the first fence, and found
himself overrunning the hounds. ‘I have my hands on
the fellow at this moment’ he continued laughingly ‘and
I could turn on him and rend him, but I spare him.’
After a few graceful and characteristic sentences concerning
the Club and its object, and Omar, and expressing
his appreciation of his reception Mr. Meredith said in
conclusion: ‘I thank you from my heart, everyone of
you.’”</p>

<p>Much to William Sharp’s satisfaction he was elected
member of the Omar Khayyam Club in the autumn of the
same year. On receipt of the announcement of the fact
the new member wrote to the President:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span></p>

<p class="pr5 p1 reduct"><span class="smcap">Rutland House</span>,</p>
<p class="pr4">2d Nov., 1895.</p>

<p class="pn"><span class="smcap">Dear Brother-in-Omar</span>,</p>

<div class="pbq">
<p>On my return from Scotland the other day I found a
note informing me that I had been elected an Omarian
on the nomination of your distinguished self.</p>

<p>My thanks, cher confrère. ‘A drop of my special grape
to you,’ as Omar might say, if he were now among us
with a Hibernian accent! Herewith I post to you another
babe, born into this ungrateful world so recently as yesterday....
Such as it is, I hope you may like it. “Ecce
Puella” itself was written at white heat&mdash;and ran in
ripples off the brain: and so is probably readable.</p>

<p>“Fragments from The Lost Journals of Piero di
Cosimo” when they appeared (some few years ago) won
the high praise of Pater&mdash;but perhaps their best distinction
is that they took in the cocksure and levelled the
Omniscient. One critical wight complained that I was
not literal (probably from the lack of knowledge of medieval
Italian), which he clinched by the remark that he
had compared my version with the original! I see that
Silas Hocking has just published a book called “All men
are liars.” I would fain send a copy to that critic, even
now. By the way, my cousin Miss Fiona Macleod wrote
to me the other day for your address. I understand she
wanted to send you a copy of her new book. If you get
it, you should, as a folk-lorist, read the titular story, <i>The
Sin-Eater</i>.</p>

<p>My wife joins with me in cordial regards, and I am</p></div>

<p class="pr6 reduct">Sincerely yours,</p>
<p class="pr4 reduct"><span class="smcap">William Sharp</span>.</p>

<p class="p1">The President replied:</p>

<p class="pr6 p1 reduct">19 <span class="smcap">Carleton Road</span>,</p>
<p class="pr5 reduct"><span class="smcap">Tufnell Park</span></p>
<p class="pr4 reduct">5th Nov.</p>

<p class="pn"><span class="smcap">My dear Sharp</span>,</p>

<p class="pbq">It is an addition to the pleasant memories of my year
of office to know that you are of the elect. You come in
with Lang and Gissing. By the way, the next dinner is
fixed for the sixth proximo. And it is an addition to a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
burden of obligation willingly borne which your kind gift
imposes. For work such as yours has unending charm
for me, because while Science was my first love and is
still my dear mistress, I love her more for what she suggests
than what she reveals. Facts, unrelated, bore me:
only in their significance does one get abiding interest.
That is why your ‘Vistas’ and such like delicate, throbbing
things attract me. Some of these were especially
welcome on a recent dull Sunday by our ‘cold restless
sea,’ on which in bright days you promise to come with
Allen to look at it from my window. Your delicious story
of the critic sent me straight to the Journal of di Cosimo.
How well you produce the archaic flavour: the style has
a Celtic ring about it. As for ‘Ecce Puella’ I await the
hearing of it from the voice of a ‘puella’ who likes your
work. I was at Meredith’s on Sunday week: he keeps
wonderfully well for him: his talk is bright as his face is
beautiful. He has his fling at me over the Burford
Bridge deception, and says that my duplicity cost you all
a fine speech. I tell him that the speech we had was good
enough for ‘the likes of us.’ So Fiona Macleod is your
cousin! She is of the ‘elect.’ I take it as most kind of
her to send me her new book, which I have as yet but
partly read, and am about to acknowledge. She holds a
weird, strong pen, and will help the Celt to make further
conquest of the dullard Saxons. Meredith and I talked
about her “<i>Mountain Lovers</i>” when I was with him in
August.</p>

<p class="pbq">Kindest regards to Mrs. Sharp and yourself.</p>

<p class="pr6 reduct">Yours sincerely,</p>
<p class="pr4 reduct"><span class="smcap">Edward Clodd</span>.</p>

<p class="p1">In the Autumn of 1894 we had come in touch with Professor
and Mrs. Patrick Geddes of Edinburgh, and a
friendship with far reaching results for “Fiona Macleod”
arose between the two men. Both were idealists,
keen students of life and nature; cosmopolitan in outlook
and interest, they were also ardent Celts who believed in
the necessity of preserving the finer subtle qualities and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
the spiritual heritage of their race against the encroaching
predominance of materialistic ideas and aims of the
day.</p>

<p>It was the desire and dream of such idealists and
thinkers as Professor Geddes, and those associated with
him, to preserve and nurture what is of value and of
spiritual beauty in the race, so that it should fuse into
and work with, or become part of, the great acquisitions
and marvellous discoveries of modern thought. To hold
to the essential beauty and thought of the past, while
going forward eagerly to meet the new and ever increasing
knowledge, was the desire of both men. In their aims
they were in sympathy with one another; their manner of
approach and methods of work were different. Patrick
Geddes&mdash;biologist&mdash;was concerned primarily with the
practical and scientific expression of his ideals; William
Sharp was concerned primarily with expression through
the art of words. Mutually sympathetic, they were eager
to find some way of collaboration.</p>

<p>It was the dream of Professor Geddes to restore to
Scotland something of its older pre-eminence in the world
of thought, to recreate in Edinburgh an active centre
and so arrest the tremendous centralising power of the
metropolis of London; to replace the stereotyped methods
of education by a more vital and synthetic form;
and to encourage national art and literature. Towards
the carrying out of these aims he had built a University
Hall and Settlement for students, artists, etc. Perhaps
the most important of his schemes, certainly the
most important from the modern scientific point of view
was the planning of the Outlook Tower&mdash;once an observatory&mdash;now
an educational museum on the Castle Rock
commanding a magnificent view of the city, of the surrounding
country, of sea and sky; “an institution that
is designed to be a method of viewing the problems of
the science of life.” According to Professor Geddes “Our
little scholastic colony in the heart of Edinburgh symbolises
a movement which while national to the core, is really
cosmopolitan in its intellectual reach<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>.”</p>

<p>Grouped with this scientific effort, was the aim to revive
the Celtic influence in art and literature; and the
little colony contained a number of men and women who
were working to that end; notably among the painters
were James Cadenhead, Charles Mackie, Robert Burns,
John Duncan, also Pittendrigh MacGillivray the sculptor;
and among the writers Professor Arthur Thomson, Dr.
Douglas Hyde, Nora Hopper, Rosa Mulholland, A. Percival
Graves, S. R. Crockett, Elisée Réclus, Alexander
Carmichael, Victor Branford, Professor Patrick Geddes,
F. M. and W. S.</p>

<p>Into that eager and sympathetic atmosphere of linked
thought and aim my husband and I were speedily drawn;
and before long a Publishing Firm was established for
the issuing of Celtic Literature and Works on Science.
To Mr. and Mrs. Geddes was confided the important secret
relating to the personality of “Fiona Macleod,” to
the thoughts and ideals that unlay ‘her’ projected work.
It was arranged that William Sharp should be the Manager
in the Firm of Patrick Geddes &amp; Colleagues (which
post he very soon relinquished for that of Literary Adviser);
an arrangement which made it possible for that
particular Colleague to publish three of his “F. M.”
books under his immediate supervision and from what
was then one of the centres of the Celtic movement.
This post, naturally, necessitated frequent visits to
Edinburgh. For the month of August 1895 we took
a flat in the neighbourhood of the University settlement
so that we might share actively in the Summer
Session.</p>

<p>It was an interesting experience. The students came
from England, Scotland, France, Italy, and Germany;
among the lecturers in addition to Professors Geddes and
Arthur Thomson were Elisée Réclus the geographer and
his brother Elie Réclus, Edmond Demolins and Abbé
Klein.</p>

<p>W. S. prepared his lectures in rough outline. His inexperience
in such work led him to plan them as though
he were drafting out twelve books, with far more material<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
than he could possibly use in the time at his disposal.
His subject was “Art and Life” divided into ten lectures:</p>

<p>One lecture only was delivered; for during it he was
seized with a severe heart attack and all his notes fell
to the ground. It was with the greatest effort that he
was able to bring the lecture to a close: and he realised
that he must not attempt to continue the course; the
risk was too great. Therefore, while I remained in Edinburgh
to keep open house for the entertainment of the
students, he went to the little Pettycur Inn at Kinghorn,
on the north side of The Firth of Forth, till I was able
to join him at Tighnabruaich in the Kyles of Bute where
we had taken a cottage with his mother and sisters for
September.</p>

<p>Two volumes of short stories were published in the
late Autumn. It was the writer’s great desire that work
should be issued by W. S. and by F. M. about the same
time; in part to sustain what reputation belonged to his
older Literary self, and in part to help to preserve the
younger literary self’s incognito. <i>Ecce Puella</i> published
by Mr. Elkin Matthew for W. S. was a collection of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
stories &amp;c. that had been written at different times and
issued in various magazines, and prefaced by a revised
and shortened version of the Monograph on “Fair
Women in Painting and Poetry.” It contained among
other short stories one entitled “The Sister of Compassion,”
dedicated “to that Sister of compassion for all
suffering animals, Mrs. Mona Caird,” our dear friend.
The other volume contained the first series of barbaric
tales and myths of old Celtic days, “recaptured in
dreams,” that followed in quick succession from the pen
of Fiona Macleod. <i>The Sin-Eater</i> was the first of the
three F. M. books published by the new Scoto-Celtic
publishers. The Author was gratified by favourable
reviews from important journals, and by letters, from
which I select two.</p>

<p>The first is from Mr. Hamilton W. Mabie:</p>


<p class="pr6 p1 reduct"><span class="smcap">The Outlook</span>,</p>
<p class="pr5 reduct">13 <span class="smcap">Astor Place</span>,</p>
<p class="pr4 reduct">May 23d, 1897.</p>

<p class="pn"><span class="smcap">My dear Friend</span>,</p>

<p class="pbq"><i>The Sin-Eater</i> came in holiday week and was one of
my most welcome remembrances. I have read it with
deep pleasure, almost with envy; so full is it of the
stuff which makes literature. It has the vitality and
beauty of a rich and living imagination. The secrets
of the spirit are in it, and that fellowship with the profounder
experiences which gets at the heart of a race.
I have not forgotten your kind words about my own
work; words which gave me new heart and hope. For
you are the very type of man to whose mind I should
like to appeal. The judgment of Mrs. Sharp, which you
quote, gave me sincere pleasure. To get the attention
of the few for whose opinion one cares most is a piece
of great good fortune; to really find one’s way to their
hearts is best of all. I am looking forward to a good
long talk with you. I wish you were here today. This
is a divine May; balmy, fragrant, fresh; as if it had
never been here before. There is enough <i>soul</i> in Miss
Macleod’s stories to set up a generation of average novelists.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
The work of the real writer seems to me a miracle;
something from the sources of our life. I have
found, however, so few among all my good literary
friends who feel about literature as I do that I have
felt at times as if I had no power of putting into words
what lies in my heart. This does not mean that I have
missed appreciation; on the contrary, I have had more
than I deserve. But most of the younger men here regard
literature so exclusively as a craft and so little as
a revelation that I have often missed the kind of fellowship
which you gave me. The deeper feeling is, however,
coming back to us in the work of some of the newest
men&mdash;Bliss Carman for instance. There is below such
a book as “Vistas” a depth and richness of imagination
which have rarely been disclosed here. I hope you will
find time to send me an occasional letter. You will do
me a real service. I am now at work on a book which
I hope will be deeper and stronger than anything I have
done yet. There is the stir of a new life here, although
it may be long in getting itself adequately expressed.</p>

<p class="pr6 reduct">Yours fraternally,</p>
<p class="pr4 reduct"><span class="smcap">Hamilton W. Mabie</span>.</p>

<p class="p1">The second is from Sir George Douglas, poet, scholar,
and keen critic:</p>

<p class="pr5 p1 reduct"><span class="smcap">Springwood Park, Kelso</span>,</p>
<p class="pr4 reduct">23:12:95.</p>

<p class="pn"><span class="smcap">My dear Sharp</span>,</p>

<p class="pbq">Many thanks for your interesting letter and enclosures.
I am very glad to find that you think I have understood
Miss Macleod’s work, and I think it very good of her
to have taken my out-spoken criticisms in such good part.
Certainly if she thinks I can be of any use to her in reading
over the proofs of “The Washer of the Ford,” it
will be a great pleasure to me. I shall probably be in
Italy by the time she names&mdash;the end of Feb. but in
these days of swift posts I hope that need not matter.
What you tell me of Fiona’s admirer is very interesting,
and from my recollection of the way in which books and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
the fancied personality of their authors possessed my
mind when I was a youth, I can well enter into his infatuation.
Fortunately there were no women among
my “influences,” or I might have been in as bad a case
as he! Would not this be a case for telling the secret,
under pledges of course, if it were only to prevent mischief?
By the way the whole incident seems to me to
afford excellent material for literary treatment&mdash;not by
you perhaps, nor yet by me (for the literary element
in the material puts it outside your province, and makes
it not quite the theme I like for my own use either) but
say, for W.</p>

<p class="pr6 reduct">Yours ever sincerely,</p>
<p class="pr4 reduct"><span class="smcap">George Douglas</span>.</p>

<p>I do not quite agree with you as to the inception of
Miss Macleod, and possibly this is a matter in which you
are not the best possible judge. At any rate, without
going into the matter, I fancy that I could establish the
existence in works earlier than the Poems of Phantasy
of a certain mystical tendency, (German perhaps rather
than Celtic in its colouring at that time) but none the
less akin to the mysticisms of F. M.</p>

<p>But I may be mistaken....</p>

<p class="p2">Our friend, Sir George Douglas, had followed the literary
career of William Sharp with careful interest, and
gave the same heed to the writings of “Fiona Macleod.”
After perusal of <i>The Sin-Eater</i> he made a careful study
of the two methods of work, and wrote to the author to
tell him he was finally convinced from internal evidence
that William Sharp was the author of these books under
discussion. He did not ask for confirmation but
wished the author to know his conclusions. The latter,
who valued not only the friendship but the critical appreciation
of his correspondent, made no denial, but
begged that the secret might be guarded. In Sir George
Douglas’ answer is a reference to a curious incident
which had happened while we were at Rudgwick. A<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
letter came from an unknown correspondence containing
a proposal of marriage to Fiona Macleod. Whether it
was intended as a “draw” or not we could not decide.
The proposal was apparently written in all seriousness.
Similarities of taste, details of position, profession etc.,
were carefully given. Acceptance was urged with all appearance
of seriousness; therefore the refusal was
worded with gravity befitting the occasion.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XVI</h2>

<p class="pch">THE WASHER OF THE FORD</p>

<p>Owing to the publication of <i>The Sin-Eater</i> by a firm
identified with the Scoto-Celtic movement the book attracted
immediate attention. Dr. Douglas Hyde voiced
the Irish feeling when he wrote to my husband: “I think
Fiona Macleod’s books the most interesting thing in the
new Scoto-Celtic movement, which I hope will march side
by side with our own.” This movement was according to
William Sharp “fundamentally the outcome of Ossian,
and immediately of the rising of the sap in the Irish nation.”
Following on the incentive given by such scholars
as Windische, Whitly Stokes, Kuno Meyer, and the various
Folklore societies, a Gaelic League had been formed
by enthusiasts in Ireland, and in Scotland, for the preservation
and teaching of the old Celtic tongue; for the
study of the old literatures of which priceless treasures
lay untouched in both countries, and for the encouragement
of natural racial talent. Wales had succeeded in
recovering the use of her Cymric tongue; and the expression
in music of racial sentiment had become widespread
throughout that country. Ireland and the Highlands
looked forward to attaining to a similar result; and efforts
to that end were set agoing in schools, in classes, by
means of such organisations as the Irish Feis Ceoil Committee,
the Irish Literary Society and the Irish National
Theatre. Their aim was to preserve some utterance of
the national life, to mould some new kind of romance,
some new element of thought, out of Irish life and traditions.
Among the most eager workers were Dr. Douglas
Hyde, Mr. W. B. Yeats, Mr. Standish O’Grady, Mr.
George Russell (A.E.), Dr. George Sigerson, and Lady
Gregory.</p>

<p>In Scotland much valuable work had been done by such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
men as Campbell of Islay, Cameron of Brodick, Mr. Alexander
Carmichael; by the Gaelic League and the Highland
Mod and its yearly gatherings. There were writers and
poets also who used the old language and were consequently
known within only a small area. No conspicuous
modern Celtic work had hitherto been written in the
English tongue until the appearance of the writings of
Fiona Macleod, and later of Mr. Neil Munro. <i>The Sin-Eater</i>
was therefore warmly welcomed on both sides of
the Irish Channel, and Fiona Macleod, acclaimed as the
leading representative of the Highland Gael, “our one
and only Highland novelist.” <i>The Irish Independent</i>
pronounced her to be “the poet born,” “her work is pure
romance&mdash;and she strikes a strange note in modern literature,
but it has the spirit of the Celt, and is another
triumph for the Celtic genius.”</p>

<p>In consequence of this reception, and of a special article
in <i>The Bookman</i>, speculations began to be made concerning
the unknown and unseen authoress. <i>The Highland
News</i> in pursuance of its desire to awake in the
Highlands of Scotland an active sympathy with the growing
Scoto-Celtic movement, was anxious to give some details
concerning the new writer. To that end Mr. John
Macleay wrote to William Sharp to ask if “considering
your relation towards Miss Macleod, you might be able
to tell me where I could obtain any personal information
about her.” In reply, a few sparse notes were sent; the
author in question was said to have passed her girlhood
in the West Highlands; her tastes, her dislike of towns
and her love of seclusion, were among the characteristics
described.</p>

<p>When, early in 1896, <i>The Highland News</i> wrote to several
authors to ask their views on the subject of Literature
in the Highlands, Mr. Grant Allen, Mrs. Katherine
Tynan Hinkson, Fiona Macleod and William Sharp were
among those writers whose letters, expressive of interest
and sympathy, were published.</p>

<p>The two letters contributed by my husband were written
necessarily, each from a slightly different standpoint.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
He welcomed the opportunity of appearing in print in
the two characters for he believed that it would help to
shield the secret concerning Fiona Macleod.</p>

<p>The publication by P. Geddes &amp; Coll. of <i>The Washer of
the Ford</i>&mdash;a collection of Tales and Legendary Moralities&mdash;aroused
a fresh outbreak of curiosity. For instance,
a sensational article appeared in <i>The Highland
News</i> on the vexed question of the identity of the Highland
writer, headed: “Mystery! Mystery! All in a
Celtic Haze.”</p>

<p>According to it: “Highland Celts in Glasgow are, I
hear, hot on the scent of what they imagine to be a female
James Macpherson. This, of course, is Miss Fiona Macleod.
The way which Miss Macleod has led our Glasgow
countrymen is strange indeed, and the literary detective
has been busy. In the first place, it is asserted
that Miss Fiona Macleod does not exist. No one seems
to have seen her. One gentleman called twice at her residence
in Edinburgh, and Miss Macleod was out. She has
written about Iona, but again in that well watched place
her name is unknown. The natural inference, you will
admit, is that there is something here to be “fahnd aht,”
as the Englishman says. Seeing that the non-existence
of Miss Fiona Macleod has been thus established, the
next point is who wrote those books to which that name
is attached. Now, Mr. William Sharp has declared himself
to be Miss Fiona Macleod’s uncle; he has, too, interested
himself in Celtic things. Isn’t it the second natural
inference that he has written the books? But Mr.
Sharp has specifically denied the authorship. Then, of
course, it must be Mr. and Mrs. Sharp in collaboration.
But again comes denial. Mr. Sharp has addressed the
following note to the Glasgow “Evening News,” which
has been somewhat persistent in casting doubt on the
existence of Miss Macleod&mdash;“Miss Fiona Macleod is not
Mr. William Sharp, Miss Fiona Macleod is not Mrs.
William Sharp, Miss Fiona Macleod is&mdash;Miss Fiona Macleod.”
The persecuted author was much disturbed by
this effort to draw Fiona Macleod into a controversy, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
force her to declare herself. Not only was he indignant
at what to him was an unwarrantable interference with
the privacy of the individual, and resented the traps that
were laid to catch the author should “she” be ‘unwary,’
it was instrumental also in making him much more determined
to guard his secret at all costs. During the
months of controversy the subject of it accomplished a
considerable amount of work.</p>

<p>He collaborated with me in the preparation of an Anthology
of Celtic Poetry; prepared an edition of <i>Ossian</i>
(P. Geddes &amp; Coll.) for which he wrote a long introduction;
and began to work upon a humourous novel, not,
however, finished until 1898.</p>

<p>As F. M. he published <i>The Washer of the Ford</i> in
April, wrote <i>Green Fire</i>, and also a number of
Poems, which were subsequently included in <i>From the
Hills of Dream</i>. His Diary for the New Year has this
entry:</p>

<p class="pbq p1"><i>“Jany 7th, 1896.</i> <i>The British Weekly</i> has a paragraph
given under all reserve that Fiona Macleod is Mrs.
William Sharp. Have written&mdash;as W. S.&mdash;to Dr. R.
Nicoll and to Mrs. Macdonell of <i>The Bookman</i> to deny
this authoritatively.”</p>

<p class="p1">From the first we decided that it would be advisable to
admit that F. M. was my cousin, also, that my husband
acted as her adviser and ‘right hand’ in the matter of
publishing.</p>

<p>The arrangements for the two first books were made by
W. S. in person. No such precautions were necessary
for the books brought out by P. Geddes &amp; Col. as the head
of the firm was in the secret. But, as it was well known
in Edinburgh and elsewhere that William Sharp was
keenly interested in the ‘Celtic Movement,’ he thought it
well to collaborate with me on an Anthology of Celtic
Poetry entitled <i>Lyra Celtica</i> (and published by the firm),
for which he prepared an Introduction and Notes.</p>

<p>On the 6th January, in a letter to Mrs. William Rossetti
he wrote “Just back from France where I went so
far with my wife on her way to Central Italy. Her health<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
has given way, alas, and she has been sent out from this
killing climate for 3 or 4 months at any rate.”</p>

<p>At the end of January he wrote to me:</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“Only a brief line to thank you for your letter about
<i>me</i> and <i>Fiona</i>. Every word you say is true and urgent,
and even if I did not know it to be so I would pay the
most searching heed to any advice from you, in whose
insight and judgment mentally as well as spiritually I
have such deep confidence. Although in the main I had
come to exactly the same standpoint I was wavering before
certain alluring avenues of thought.... If I live
to be an elderly man, time enough for one or more of my
big philosophical and critical works. Meanwhile&mdash;the
flame!</p>

<p class="pbq">The only thing of the kind I will now do&mdash;and that
not this year&mdash;will be the “Introduction to the Study of
Celtic Literature”: but for that I have the material to
hand, and shall largely use in magazines first.... Well,
we shall begin at once! February will be wholly given
over to finishing <i>Wives in Exile</i> and <i>The Washer of the
Ford</i>.”</p>

<p class="p1">On the 1st February he left town and settled down to
work at the Pettycur Inn, Kinghorn, Fife. His Diary
gives the following record of work:</p>

<div class="pbq">
<p class="p1">“<i>Feb. 3rd.</i> Wrote the Preface to <i>The Washer of the
Ford</i>.</p>

<p>“<i>Feb. 7th.</i> Dictated (1750 words) article on Modern
Romantic Art, for the Glasgow Herald&mdash;Also <i>World</i>
article.</p>

<p>“<i>Feb. 9th.</i> Wrote ‘The Festival of the Birds.’</p>

<p>“<i>Feb. 10th.</i> Glasgow Herald Article (1500 words) on
The Art of the Goldsmith, and wrote ‘The Blessing of
the Fishes.’”</p></div>

<p class="p1">In the middle of February William had written to Mr.
R. Murray Gilchrist, one of the few friends who then
knew the secret of the pseudonym:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span></p>


<p class="pn1"><span class="smcap">My dear Gilchrist</span>,</p>

<div class="pbq">
<p>Fiona Macleod has suddenly begun to attract a great
deal of attention. There have been leaders as well as
long and important reviews: and now the chief North of
Scotland paper, <i>The Highland News</i>, is printing two
long articles devoted in a most eulogistic way to F. M.
and her influence “already so marked and so vital, so
that we accept her as the leader of the Celtic Renaissance
in Scotland.” There is, also, I hear, to be a Magazine
article on her. This last week there have been
long and favourable reviews in the <i>Academy</i> and <i>The
New Age</i>.</p>

<p>I am glad you like my other book, I mean W. S’s!
[<i>Ecce Puella</i>] There are things in it which are as absolutely
out of my real self as it is possible to be: and I am
glad that you recognise this. I have not yet seen my book
of short stories published in America under the title <i>The
Gypsy Christ</i>, though it has been out some weeks: and
I have heard from one or two people about it. America
is more indulgent to me just now than I deserve. For a
leading American critic writes of <i>The Gypsy Christ</i> that,
“though it will offend some people and displease others,
it is one of the most remarkable volumes I have read for
long. The titular story has an extraordinary, even a
dreadful impressiveness: ‘Madge o’ the Pool’ is more
realistic than ‘realism’: and alike in the scathing society
love-episode, ‘The Lady in Hosea,’ and in that brilliant
Algerian <i>conte</i>, ‘The Coward,’ the author suggests the
method and power of Guy de Maupassant.”</p>

<p>I hope to get the book soon, and to send you a copy.
As I think I told you, the setting of the G/C is entirely
that which I knew through you. I have made use of one
or two features&mdash;exaggerated facts and half facts&mdash;which
I trust will not displease you. Do you remember my
feeling about those gaunt mine-chimneys: I always
think of them now when I think of the G/C. Fundamentally,
however, the story goes back to my own early
experiences&mdash;not as to the <i>facts</i> of the story, of course....
Then again, Arthur Sherburne Hardy, who is by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
many considered the St. Beuve of American criticism&mdash;in
surety and insight&mdash;has given his opinion of a book i. e.
of all he has seen of it (a comedy of the higher kind) for
which Stone and Kimball have given me good terms&mdash;<i>Wives
in Exile</i>&mdash;that it is “quite unlike anything else&mdash;at
once the most brilliant, romantic, and witty thing I
have read for long&mdash;to judge from the opening chapters
and the scheme. It will stand by itself, I think.”</p>

<p>Personally, I think it shows the best handicraft of anything
W. S. has done in fiction. It is, of course, wholly
distinct in manner and method from F. M.’s work. It
<i>ought</i> to be out by May. Sunshine and blithe laughter
guided my pen in this book. Well, I have given you my
gossip about myself: and now I would much rather hear
about <i>you</i>. I wish you were here to tell me all about what
you have been doing, thinking, and dreaming.</p></div>

<p class="pr6 reduct">Yours,</p>
<p class="pr4 reduct">W. S.</p>

<p class="p1">I received the following letter from him in Rome:</p>


<p class="pbqr p1"><span class="smcap">London</span>, 21st Feb.</p>

<p class="pbq">I am sure <i>The Highland News</i> must have delighted
you. Let me know what you think of Fiona’s and W. S.’s
letters.... I am so sorry you are leaving Siena.... I
follow every step of your movements with keenest interest.
But oh the light and the colour, how I envy you!</p>

<p class="pbq">I am hoping you are pleased with <i>Lyra Celtica</i>. It is
published today only&mdash;so of course I have heard nothing
yet from outsiders. Yesterday I finished my Matthew
Arnold essay<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>&mdash;and in the evening wrote the first part
of my F. M. story, “Morag of the Glen”&mdash;a strong piece
of work I hope and believe though not finished yet. I
hope to finish it by tonight. I am so glad you and
Mona liked the first of “The Three Marvels of Hy”
(pronounced <i>Eo</i> or <i>Hee</i>) so well. Pieces like “The Festival
of the Birds” seem to be born out of my brain almost<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
in an inspirational way. I hardly understand it. Yes,
you were in the right place to read it&mdash;St. Francis’ country.
That beautiful strange Umbria! After all, Iona
and Assisi are not nearly so remote from each other as
from London or Paris. I send you the second of the
series “The Blessing of the Flies.” It, too, was written
at Pettycur&mdash;as was “The Prologue.” ... There is a
strange half glad, half morose note in this Prologue
which I myself hardly apprehend in full significance. In
it is interpolated one of the loveliest of the ‘legendary
moralities’ which I had meant to insert in Section I&mdash;that
of ‘The King of the Earth.’ I will send it to you
before long....</p>

<p class="p1">To a correspondent he wrote about the “Three
Marvels of Hy”: “They are studies in old Religious
Celtic sentiment so far as that can be recreated in a modern
heart that feels the same beauty and simplicity of the
Early Christian faith.”</p>

<p>And to me again: “... I know you will rejoice to
hear that there can be no question that F. M’s deepest
and finest work is in this “<i>Washer of the Ford</i>” volume.
As for the spiritual lesson that nature has taught me,
and that has grown within me otherwise, I have given
the finest utterance to it that I can. In a sense my inner
life of the spirit is concentrated in the three pieces “The
Moon-Child,” “The Fisher of Men,” and “The Last Supper.”
Than the last I shall never do anything better.
Apart from this intense inner flame that has been burning
within me so strangely and deeply of late&mdash;I think
my most imaginative work will be found in the titular
piece “The Washer of the Ford,” which still, tho’ written
and revised some time ago, haunts me! and in that
and the pagan and animistic “Annir Choille.” We shall
read those things in a gondola in Venice?”</p>

<p>He joined me in Venice on the 16th May&mdash;glad of
sunshine and rest. We journeyed back to England by
way of the Lakes, in a time of early roses, and returned
to London to find the first copies of <i>The Washer of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
Ford</i> awaiting us. Two out of many letters concerning
the book that came to him from friends who were in the
secret and watched the development of the “F. M.” work,
were a strong incentive to further effort.</p>

<p>The first is from Mr. Frank Rinder:</p>


<p class="pn1"><span class="smcap">My dear Will</span>,</p>

<p class="pbq">From my heart I thank you for the gift of this book.
It adds to the sum of the precious, heaven-sent things in
life. It will kindle the fire of hope, of aspiration and of
high resolve in a thousand hearts. As one of those into
whose life you have brought a more poignant craving
for what is beautiful in word and action, I thank you for
writing it.</p>

<p class="pr6 reduct">Your friend,</p>
<p class="pr4 reduct"><span class="smcap">Frank</span>.</p>

<p class="p1">The second was from Mr. Janvier:</p>


<p class="pr5 p1 reduct"><span class="smcap">Saint Remy de Provence</span>,</p>
<p class="pr4 reduct">June 22, 1896.</p>

<p class="pn"><span class="smcap">My dear Will</span>,</p>

<div class="pbq">
<p>If <i>The Washer of the Ford</i> were the first of Fiona’s
books I am confident that the sex of its author would not
pass unchallenged. A great part of it is essentially masculine&mdash;all
the “Seanachas,” and “The Annir Choille,”
and the opening of “The Washer”: not impossible for
a woman to write, but unlikely. Nor would a woman have
written “The Annir Choille,” I think, as it is written
here. Fiona has shown her double sex in this story more
completely, it seems to me, than in any other. It is written
with a man’s sense of decency and a woman’s sense of
delicacy&mdash;and the love of both man and woman is in it
to a very extraordinary degree. The fighting stories
seem to me to be pure man&mdash;though I suppose that there
are Highland women (like Scott’s “Highland Widow”)
capable of their stern savagery. But on these alone, Fiona’s
sex scarcely could have been accepted unchallenged.
But what seems to me to show plainest, in all the stories
together, is not the trifle that they are by a man or by a
woman but that they have come out of your inspired soul.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
They seem to be the result of some outside force constraining
you to write them. And with their freshness
they have a curious primordial flavour&mdash;that comes, I
suppose, from the deep roots and full essences of life
which are their substance of soul. Being basic, elementary,
they are independent of time; or even race. In a
literary&mdash;technically literary&mdash;way they seem to me to
be quite your most perfect work. I am sensitive to word
arrangement, and some of your work has made me rather
disposed to swear at you for carelessness. You have not
always taken the trouble to hunt for the word that you
needed. But these stories are as nearly perfect in finish,
I think, as literary endeavour can make them. And they
have that effect of flow and ease that can only come&mdash;at
least, I can imagine it only as arriving&mdash;from the most
persistent and laborious care. In the detail of make-up,
I am especially impressed by the insertion of the Shadow
Seers just where the key is changed radically. They are
at once your justifying pieces for what has gone before,
and an orchestral interlude before the wholly different
Seanachas begin. Of all in the book, my strongest affection
is for “The Last Supper.” It seems to me to be the
most purely beautiful, and the profoundest thing that
you have done.</p>

<p>I feel that some strong new current must have come
into your life; or that the normal current has been in
some way obstructed or diverted&mdash;for the animating
spirit of these new books reflects a radical change in your
own soul. The Pagan element is entirely subordinated
to and controlled by the inner passions of the soul. In a
word you have lifted your work from the flesh-level to
the soul-level....</p>

<p>What you say in your letter of worry and ill-health
saddens me. It is unjust that your rare power of creation
should be hampered in any way. But it seems to
me that there must be great consolation in your certain
knowledge that you have greatly created, in spite of all.</p></div>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XVII</h2>

<p class="pch">“RUNES OF THE SORROW OF WOMEN”</p>

<p class="pc"><i>Green Fire</i></p>

<p class="p2">During the most active years of the Fiona Macleod
writings, the author was usually in a highly wrought condition
of mental and emotional tension, which produced
great restlessness, so that he could not long remain contentedly
anywhere. We spent the summer of 1896 moving
about from one place to another that had special interest
for him. First we went to Bamborough, for sea-bathing
(he was a fine swimmer), and to visit the little
Holy Isle of the Eastern Shores, Lindisfarne, Iona’s
daughter. Thence to the Clyde to be near his mother and
sisters. From Inverness we went to the Falls of Lora,
in Ossian’s country, and later we moved to one of William’s
favourite haunts, Loch Tarbert, off Loch Fyne,
where our friends Mr. and Mrs. Frank Rinder had taken
a house for the summer. There I left him with his secretary-sister,
Mary, and returned to London to recommence
my work on <i>The Glasgow Herald</i>. The two following
letters to me told of the progress of his work:</p>

<p class="pbqr p1">September 23d.</p>

<p class="pbq">I am now well in writing trim I am glad to say. Two
days ago I wrote the long-awaited “Rune of the Passion
of Woman” the companion piece in a sense to the ‘Chant
of Woman’ in <i>Pharais</i>&mdash;and have also done the <i>Savoy</i>
story “The Archer” (about 4,500 words) and all but
done “Ahez the Pale.” Today I hope to get on with
the “Lily Leven.” ...</p>

<p class="pbq">I must make the most of this day of storm for writing.
I had a splendid long sleep last night, and feel ‘spiff.’ ...
I am not built for mixed companies, and like them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
less and less in proportion as the imperative need of
F. M. and W. S. for greater isolation grows. I realise
more and more the literal truth of what George Meredith
told me&mdash;that renunciation of ordinary social pleasures
(namely of the ordinary kind in the ordinary way) is a
necessity to any worker on the high levels: and unless I
work that way I shall not work at all.</p>

<p class="pbqr p1">26th Sept.</p>

<div class="pbq">
<p>... Yesterday turned out a splendid breezy day, despite
its bad opening: one of the most beautiful we have
had, altho’ too cold for bathing, and too rough for boating.
I went off by myself for a long sail&mdash;and got back
about 4. Later I went alone for an hour or so to revise
what had stirred me so unspeakably, namely the third
and concluding “Rune of the Sorrow of Women.” This
last Rune tired me in preliminary excitement and in the
strange semi-conscious fever of composition more than
anything of the kind since I wrote the first of the three
in <i>Pharais</i> one night of storm when I was alone in Phenice
Croft.</p>

<p>I have given it to Mary to copy, so that I can send it to
you at once. Tell me what you think and feel about it.
In a vague way not only you, Mona, Edith and others
swam into my brain, but I have never so absolutely felt
the woman-soul within me: it was as though in some
subtle way the soul of Woman breathed into my brain&mdash;and
I feel vaguely as if I had given partial expression at
least to the inarticulate voice of a myriad women who
suffer in one or other of the triple ways of sorrow. For
work, and rebuilding energy, I am thankful I came here.
You were right: I was not really fit to go off to the Hebrides
alone, at the present juncture, and might well have
defeated my own end. Tomorrow morning I shall be
writing&mdash;probably at From the Hills of Dream.</p></div>

<p class="p1">From Tighnabruaich Hotel, a lovely little village in the
Kyles of Bute, he wrote to me:</p>

<p class="pbq p1">I am glad to be here, for though the weather has
changed for the worse I am so fond of the place and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
neighbourhood. But what I care for most is I am in a
strong Fiona mood, though more of dream and reverie&mdash;creatively&mdash;than
of actual writing: indeed it is likely all
my work here, or nearly all shall be done through dream
and mental-cartooning. I have written “The Snow Sleep
of Angus Ogue” for the winter <i>Evergreen</i>, and am glad
to know it is one of F. M.’s deepest and best utterances.</p>

<p class="p1"><i>The Evergreen</i> was a Quarterly started by Prof.
Geddes, of which W. S. was Editor. Five numbers only
were issued. During the autumn William had prepared
for publication by P. Geddes &amp; Coll a re-issue of the Tales
contained in <i>The Sin-Eater</i> and <i>The Washer of the Ford</i>,
in the form of a paper covered edition in three volumes,
<i>Barbaric Tales</i>, <i>Spiritual Tales</i>, <i>Tragic Romances</i>. Each
volume contained a new tale. Mr. W. B. Yeats considered
that “Of the group of new voices none is more typical
than the curious mysterious voice that is revealed in
these stories of Miss Fiona Macleod.... She has become
the voice (of these primitive peoples and elemental
things) not from mere observation of their ways, but out
of an absolute identity of nature.... Her art belongs
in kind, whatever be its excellence in its kind, to a greater
art, which is of revelation, and deals with invisible and
impalpable things. Its mission is to bring us near to
those powers and principalities, which we divine in mortal
hopes and passions.</p>

<p class="p2">Mr. W. E. Henley had shown considerable interest in
the “F. M.” Tales, and had written an appreciative letter
to the author, who immediately acknowledged it:</p>


<p class="pbqr p1">1:4:97.</p>

<p class="pn"><span class="smcap">Dear Mr. Henley</span>,</p>

<p class="pbq">I thank you for your kind letter. Any work of recognition
from you means much to me. Your advice is wise
and sane, I am sure&mdash;and you may be certain that I shall
bear it in mind. It will be difficult to follow&mdash;for absolute
simplicity is the most difficult of all styles, being, as it
must be, the expression of a mind at once so imaginative<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
in itself, so lucid in its outlook, and so controlled in its
expression, that only a very few rarely gifted individuals
can hope to achieve the isolating ideal you indicate.</p>

<p class="pbq">The three latest things I have written are the long
short-story “Morag of the Glen,” “The Melancholy of
Ulad,” and “The Archer.” I would particularly like to
know what you think of the style and method of “The
Archer” (I mean, apart from the arbitrary fantasy of
the short supplementary part&mdash;which affords the clue
to the title)&mdash;as there I have written, or tried to write,
with the accent of that life as I know it.</p>

<p class="pbqr">F. M.</p>

<p class="p1">The central story of “The Archer” was one of the
Tales which the author valued most, and rewrote many
times. In its final form&mdash;“Silas,” in the Tauchnitz volume
of F. M. Tales&mdash;it stands without the opening and closing
episodes. Concerning the “fantasy of the short supplementary
part” a curious coincidence happened. That
arbitrary fantasy is the record of a dream, or vision,
which the author had at Tarbert. In a letter from Mr.
Yeats received shortly after, the Irish poet related a similar
experience which he had had&mdash;a vision of a woman
shooting arrows among the stars&mdash;a vision that appeared
also the same night to Mr. Arthur Symons. I remember
the exchange of letters that passed between the three
writers; unfortunately Fiona’s letter to Mr. Symons, and
the latter’s answer, are not available. But I have two of
the letters on the subject which, through the courtesy of
Mr. Yeats, I am able to quote; both, unfortunately are
undated. F. M. describes a second vision which, however,
had no connection with the coincidence.</p>

<p>Mr. Yeats wrote:</p>

<p class="pr5 p1 reduct"><span class="smcap">Tillyra Castle,</span></p>
<p class="pr4 reduct"><span class="smcap">Co. Galway.</span></p>

<p class="pn"><span class="smcap">My dear Sharp</span>,</p>

<p class="pbq">Many thanks for your letter. You must have written
it the very morning I was writing to Miss Macleod. I
have just returned from the Arran Islands where I had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
gone on a fishing boat, and where I go again at the end
of this week. I am studying on the islands for the opening
chapter of a story I am about to set out upon. I met
two days ago an old man who hears the fairies he says
every night and complains much that their singing keeps
him awake. He showed me a flute which he had got thinking
that if he played it they might be pleased and so cease
teasing him. I have met much curious lore here and in
Arran.</p>

<p class="pbq">I have had some singular experiences myself. I invoked
one night the spirits of the moon and saw between
sleep and waking a beautiful woman firing an arrow
among the stars. That night she appeared to Symons
who is staying here, and so impressed him that he wrote
a poem on her the only one he ever wrote to a dream, calling
her the fountain of all song or some such phrase.
She was the symbolic Diana. I invoked a different spirit
another night and it appeared in dreams to an old French
Count, who was staying here, and was like Symons ignorant
of my invocations. He locked his door to try to
keep it out. Please give my greetings to Miss Macleod.</p>

<p class="pr6 reduct">Yours Sincerely,</p>
<p class="pr4 reduct"><span class="smcap">W. B. Yeats</span>.</p>

<p class="p1">F. M. wrote in acknowledgment of a long critical letter
from Mr. Yeats, to whom “she” had sent <i>The Washer
of the Ford</i>:</p>


<p class="pbqr p1"><span class="smcap">Tarbert on Loch Fyne.</span></p>

<p class="pn"><span class="smcap">Dear Mr. Yeats</span>,</p>

<div class="pbq">
<p>Unforeseen circumstances have prevented my writing
to you before this, and even now I must perforce be more
brief than I would fain be in response to your long and
deeply interesting as well as generous letter. Alas, a
long pencilled note (partly apropos of your vision of the
woman shooting arrows, and of the strange coincidence
of something of the same kind on my own part) has long
since been devoured by a too voracious or too trustful
gull&mdash;for a sudden gust of wind blew the quarto-sheet
from off the deck of the small yacht wherein I and my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
dear friend and confrère of whom you know were sailing,
off Skye.... How good of you to write to me as
you did. Believe me, I am grateful. There is no other
writer whose good opinion could please me more&mdash;for I
love your work, and take an endless delight in your poetry,
and look to you as not only one of the rare few on
whose lips is the honey of Magh Mell but as one the dark
zone of whose mind is lit with the strange stars and constellations
of the spiritual life. Most cordially I thank
you for your critical remarks. Even where I do not unreservedly
agree, or where I venture to differ (as for example,
in the matter of the repetition of the titular words
in “The Washer of the Ford” poem) I have carefully
pondered all you say. I am particularly glad you feel
about the “Annir Choille” as you do. Some people
whom I would like to please do not care for it: yet I am
sure you are right in considering it one of the most vital
things I have been able to do.</p>

<p>With what delight I have read your lovely lovely poem
“O’Sullivan Rue to the Secret Rose!” I have read it
over and over with ever deepening delight. It is one of
your finest poems, I think: though perhaps it can only
be truly appreciated by those who are familiar with legendary
Celtic history. We read it to each other, my
friend and I, on a wonderful sundown “when evening fed
the wave with quiet light,” off one of the Inner Hebrides
(Colonsay, to the South of Oban).... I cannot quite
make up my mind, as you ask, about your two styles.
Personally, I incline not exactly to a return to the earlier
but to a marriage of the two: that is, a little less remoteness,
or subtlety, with a little more of rippling clarity.
After reading your Blake paper (and with vivid interest
and delight) I turned to an early work of yours which I
value highly, <i>Dhoya</i>: and I admit that my heart moved to
<i>it</i>. Between them lies, I think, your surest and finest
line of work&mdash;with the light deft craft of <i>The Celtic Twilight</i>.</p>

<p>I hope you are soon going to issue the promised volume
of poems. When my own book of verse is ready&mdash;it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
to be called <i>From the Hills of Dream</i>&mdash;it will give me
such sincere pleasure to send you a copy. By the bye, I
must not forget to thank you for introducing my work
to Mr. Arthur Symons. He wrote to me a pleasant letter,
and asked me to contribute to the <i>Savoy</i>, which I have
done. I dare say my friend (who sends you comradely
greetings, and says he will write in a day or two) will tell
you more from me when he and you meet.</p>

<p>I had a strange vision the other day, wherein I saw the
figure of a gigantic woman sleeping on the green hills of
Ireland. As I watched, the sun waned and the dark came
and the stars began to fall. They fell one by one, and
each fell into the woman&mdash;and lo, of a sudden, all was
bare running water, and the drowned stars and the transmuted
woman passed from my seeing. This was a waking
dream, an open vision: but I do not know what it
means, though it was so wonderfully vivid. In a vague
way I realise that something of tremendous moment is
being matured just now. We are on the verge of vitally
important developments. And all the heart, all the brain,
of the Celtic races shall be stirred. There is a shadow of
mighty changes. Myself, I believe that new spirits have
been embodied among us. And some of the old have come
back. We shall perish, you and I and all who fight under
the “Lifting of the Sunbeam”&mdash;but we shall pioneer a
wonderful marvellous new life for humanity. The other
day I asked an old islesman where her son was buried.
“He was not buried,” she said, “for all they buried his
body. For a week ago I saw him lying on the heather,
and talking swift an’ wild with a Shadow.” <i>The Shadows
are here.</i></p>

<p>I must not write more just now.</p></div>

<p class="pr8 reduct">My cordial greetings to you,</p>
<p class="pr6 reduct">Sincerely,</p>
<p class="pr4 reduct"><span class="smcap">Fiona Macleod</span>.</p>

<p class="p1">No sooner had W. S. returned to London than he fell ill
with nervous prostration, and rheumatism. It was soon
obvious that he could not remain in town, and that for a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
short time at any rate he must cease from pen-work. It
therefore seemed an opportune moment for him to go to
New York, and attend to his publishing interests there,
especially as Messrs. Stone &amp; Kimball had recently failed.</p>

<p>Before starting he had read and reviewed with much
interest a volume of poems by the American poet, Mrs.
Elizabeth Stoddard, and had received a pleased acknowledgment
from her husband Richard A. Stoddard:</p>

<p class="pr5 p1 reduct"><span class="smcap">New York</span>,</p>
<p class="pr4 reduct">Oct. 30, 1896.</p>

<p class="pn"><span class="smcap">My dear Sharp</span>,</p>

<p class="pbq">I am greatly obliged to you for what you have written
about my wife’s poetry, any recognition of which touches
me more nearly than anything that could be said about
my own verse.... My wife has told you, I presume,
how much I enjoyed your wife’s <i>Women’s Voices</i>, just
before I went into the Hospital, and how I composed a bit
of verse in my head when I couldn’t see to feed myself.
Do you ever compose in that silent way? I have taught
myself to do without pens, ink, and paper, in verse; but
I can’t do so in prose, which would print itself in the thing
I call my mind. Give my kindest regards and warmest
good wishes to your Elizabeth, whose charming book is a
favourite with <i>my</i> Elizabeth as well, as with</p>

<p class="pr6 reduct">Yours sincerely,</p>
<p class="pr4 reduct"><span class="smcap">R. H. Stoddard</span>.</p>

<p class="p1">Later, Mr. Stedman wrote an account of a dinner given
to Mr. Stoddard to which W. S. was invited:</p>

<p class="pr5 p1 reduct"><span class="smcap">Bronxville, N. Y.</span>,</p>
<p class="pr4 reduct">Feb. 17, 1897.</p>

<p class="pn"><span class="smcap">My dear Sharp</span>,</p>

<p class="pbq">I have received your long letter of the 25th Jany, and
also a shorter one of the 30th written at Mr. George Cotterell’s
house. I will say at the outset that I feel guilty at
seeing the name of that loveable man and true poet; for
although a year has passed since the completion of my
(Victorian) “Anthology” I have been positively unable
to write the letter which I have in my heart for him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span></p>

<p class="pbq">... The most important social matter here this
winter relating to our Guild will be a large important dinner
to be given on March 25th by the Author’s Club and
his other friends, to Richard Henry Stoddard. We are
going to try to make an exception to the rule that New
York is not good to her own, and to render a tribute somewhat
commensurate with Stoddard’s life long services,
and his quality as poet and man. A few invitations are
going to be sent to literary men abroad, and I have been
able to write about them to Besant, Dobson, Garnett and
yourself. Of course I do not expect that you will come
over here, and I am quite sure you will write a letter
which can be read at the dinner, for I have in mind your
personal friendship with Stoddard and affectionate comprehension
of his genius and career....</p>

<p class="p1">On the 13th of April Mr. Stedman wrote again to report
on the proceedings:</p>


<p class="pbq p1">Your letter to the Stoddard Banquet was by far the
best and most inclusive of the various ones received, and
it was read out to the 150 diners and met with high
favour. I mailed you the full report of the affair, but
believe I have not written you since it came off. It
proved to be the most notable literary occasion yet known
in this city&mdash;was brilliant, magnetic, enthusiastic throughout.
I felt a pride in my office as Chairman. The hall
was one of the handsomest in America, the speaking of
the most eloquent type, and full of laughter and tears.
The Stoddards were deeply gratified by your letter.</p>

<p class="pbqr">E. C. S.<br /></p>

<p class="p1">My husband arrived in New York on All Hallow E’en
and went direct to the hospitable house of Mr. Alden
whence he wrote to me:</p>

<p class="pr5 p1 reduct"><span class="smcap">Metuchen, N. J.</span>,</p>
<p class="pr4 reduct">1st Nov., 1896.</p>

<p class="pbq">... Of course nothing can be done till Wednesday.
All America is aflame with excitement&mdash;and New York
itself is at fever-heat. I have never seen such a sight as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
yesterday. The whole enormous city was a mass of flags
and innumerable Republican and Democratic insignia&mdash;with
the streets thronged with over two million people.
The whole business quarter made a gigantic parade that
took 7 hours in its passage&mdash;and the business men alone
amounted to over 100,000. Everyone&mdash;as indeed not only
America, but Great Britain and all Europe&mdash;is now looking
eagerly for the final word on Tuesday night. The
larger issues are now clearer: not merely that the Bryanite
50-cent dollar (instead of the standard 100 cent) would
have far reaching disastrous effects, but that the whole
struggle is one of the anarchic and destructive against
the organic and constructive forces. However, this tremendous
crisis will come to an end&mdash;pro tem. at any rate&mdash;on
Tuesday night....</p>

<p class="p1">During his absence, F. M.’s romance, <i>Green Fire</i>, was
published. The title was taken from a line in ‘Cathal
of the Woods,’ ‘O green fire of life, pulse of the world, O
Love!’ And the deeper meaning of the expression
‘Green Life’&mdash;so familiar to all who knew ‘Fiona Macleod’&mdash;is
suggested in a sentence at the close of the
book: “Alan knew that strange nostalgia of the mind
for impossible things. Then, wrought for a while from
his vision of green life, and flamed by another green
fire than that born of earth, he dreamed his dream.”</p>

<p>To me, the author wrote from New York:</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“ ... I am indeed glad you like <i>Green Fire</i> so well.
And you are right in your insight: Annaik <i>is</i> the real
human magnet. Ynys is an idealised type, what I mean
by Ideala or Esclarmoundo, but she did not take hold of
me like Annaik. Alan, too, is a variation of the Ian type.
But Annaik has for me a strange and deep attraction:
and I am sure the abiding personal interest must be in
<i>her</i>. You are the only one who seems to have understood
and perceived this&mdash;certainly the only one who has noticed
it. Some day I want to tell Annaik’s story in
full....”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1">The author had read much Breton lore during his study
of French Literature, and as his interest had for a time
been centred on the land of the kindred Celt, he determined
to make it the setting of a new Romance. He had
never been there, so drew on his imagination for the
depiction of the places he knew of by hearsay only. The
result, when later he judged the book in cool criticism,
he considered to be unsatisfactory as to structure and
balance. He realised, that although the Fiona impetus
produced the first chapter and the latter part, the plot
and melodramatic character of the Breton story are due
to W. S.; that the descriptions of nature are written by
F. M. and W. S. in fusion, are in character akin to the
descriptions in “The Children of Tomorrow,” written by
W. S. in his transition stage. Consequently, when in
1905, he discussed with me what he wished preserved of
his writings, he asked my promise that I would never
republish the book in its entirety.</p>

<p>In order to preserve what he himself cared for, he rewrote
the Highland portion of the book, named it “The
Herdsman” and included it in <i>The Dominion of Dreams</i>.
(In the Uniform Edition, it is placed, together with
a series of detached Thought-Fragments from <i>Green
Fire</i>, in <i>The Divine Adventure</i>, Vol. IV.) He never
carried out his intention of writing Annaik’s story in
full. Had he done so it would have been incorporated
in a story, partly reminiscent of his early sojourn
among the gipsies, and have been called <i>The Gypsy
Trail</i>.</p>

<p>Some months later Mr. W. B. Yeats wrote to W. S.:</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“I have read ‘Green Fire’ since I saw you. I do not
think it is one of your well-built stories, and I am certain
that the writing is constantly too self-consciously picturesque;
but the atmosphere, the romance of much of it, of
‘The Herdsman’ part in particular haunts me ever since
I laid it down.</p>

<p class="pbq">‘Fiona Macleod’ has certainly discovered the romance
of the remote Gaelic places as no one else has ever<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
done. She has made the earth by so much the more beautiful.”</p>

<p class="p1">And Mr. George Russell (A. E.) wrote to F. M. from
Dublin:</p>

<p class="pn1"><span class="smcap">Dear Fiona Macleod</span>,</p>

<div class="pbq">
<p>My friend, Willie Yeats, has just come by me wrapt in
a faery whirlwind, his mouth speaking great things.
He talked much of reviving the Druidic mysteries and
vaguely spoke of Scotland and you. These stirring ideas
of his are in such a blaze of light that, but for the inspiration
of a presence always full of enthusiasm, I would get
no ideas at all from him. But when he mentioned your
name and spoke of the brotherhood of the Celts and what
ties ought to unite them, I remembered a very kindly
letter which I had put on one side waiting for an excuse
to write again. So I take gladly Yeats’ theory of what
ought to be and write....</p>

<p>Thoughts inspired by what is written or said are aimed
at the original thinker and from every quarter converge
on his inner nature. Perhaps you have felt this. It
means that these people are putting fetters on you, binding
you to think in a certain way (what they expect from
you); and there is a danger of the soul getting bent so
that after its first battle it fights no more but repeats
dream upon dream its first words in answer to their demand
and it grows more voice and less soul every day.
I read <i>Green Fire</i> a few weeks ago and have fallen in
love with your haunted seas. Your nature spirit is a
little tragic. You love the Mother as I do but you seem
for ever to expect some revelation of awe from her lips
where I would hide my head in her bosom. But the
breathless awe is true also&mdash;to “meet on the Hills of
Dream,” that would not be so difficult. I think you know
that? Some time when the power falls on me I’ll send a
shadow of myself over seas just to get the feeling of the
Highlands. I have an intuition that the “fires” are
awakening somewhere in the North West. I may have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
met you indeed and not known you. We are so different
behind the veil. Some who are mighty of the mighty
there are nothing below and then waking life keeps no
memory of their victorious deeds in sleep. And if I saw
you your inner being might assume some old Druidic
garb of the soul, taking that form because you are thinking
the Druidic thought. The inner being is protean and
has a thousand changes of apparel. I sat beside a friend
and while he was meditating, the inner being started up
in Egyptian splendour robed in purple and gold. He had
chanced upon some mood of an ancient life. I write to
you of these things judging that you know of them to
some extent here: that your inner nature preserves the
memory of old initiations, so I talk to you as a comrade
on the same quest. You know too I think that these alluring
visions and thoughts are of little import unless
they link themselves unto our humanity. It means only
madness in the end. I know people whose lamps are lit
and they see wonderful things but they themselves will
not pass from vision into action. They follow beauty
only like the dwellers in Tyre whom Ezekiel denounced
“They have corrupted their wisdom by reason of their
brightness.” Leaving these mystic things aside what you
say about art is quite true except that I cannot regard
art as the “quintessential life” unless art comes to mean
the art of living more than the art of the artists....
Sometime, perhaps, if it is in the decrees of the gods (our
true selves) we may meet and speak of these things. But
don’t get enslaved by your great power of expression. It
ties the mind a little. There was an old Hermetist who
said “The knowledge of It is a divine silence and the
rest of all the senses....”</p>

<p>You ask me to give my best. Sometimes I think silence
is the best. I can feel the sadness of truth here, but not
the joy, and there must always be as exquisite a joy as
there is pain in any state of consciousness....</p></div>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XVIII</h2>

<p class="pch">FROM THE HILLS OF DREAM</p>

<p class="pc"><i>The Laughter of Peterkin</i></p>

<p class="p2">On the wanderer’s return to England his volume of
poems <i>From the Hills of Dream</i> was published by P.
Geddes &amp; Coll. The first edition was dedicated to our
godson Arthur Allhallow, younger son of Prof. and Mrs.
Patrick Geddes, who was born on that Hallow E’en the
anniversary of our Wedding-day. The volume consists
of poems, runes and lyrics, written by F. M. between
1893 and 1896; and a series of “prose rhythms” entitled
“The Silence of Amor.”</p>

<p>A sympathetic letter from Mr. Ernest Rhys, the Welsh
poet, drew a quick response:</p>

<p class="pr5 p1 reduct"><span class="smcap">Murrayfield, Midlothian</span>,</p>
<p class="pr4 reduct">23: 11: 96.</p>

<p class="pn"><span class="smcap">Dear Mr. Rhys</span>,</p>

<div class="pbq">
<p>On my coming from the West to Edinburgh, for a few
days, I found your very welcome and charming letter,
among others forwarded to me from the Outlook Tower.</p>

<p>It gratifies me very much that you, whose work I so
much admire and with whose aims and spirit I am in so
keen sympathy, care so well for the “Hills of Dream.”
These are hills where few inhabit, but comrade always
knows comrade there&mdash;and so we are sure to meet one
another, whether one carry a “London Rose” or a sheaf
of half-barbaric Hill-Runes. It may interest you to know
that the name which seems to puzzle so many people is
(though it does exist as the name “Fiona,” not only in
Ossian but at the present day, though rarely) the
Gaelic diminutive of “Fionaghal” (i. e. Flora). For the
rest&mdash;I was born more than a thousand years ago, in the
remote region of Gaeldom known as the Hills of Dream.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
There I have lived the better part of my life, my father’s
name was Romance, and that of my mother was Dream.
I have no photograph of their abode, which is just under
the quicken-arch immediately west of the sunset-rainbow.
You will easily find it. Nor can I send you a photograph
of myself. My last fell among the dew-wet heather, and
is now doubtless lining the cells of the wild bees.</p>

<p>All this authentic information I gladly send you!</p></div>

<p class="pr6 reduct">Sincerely yours,</p>
<p class="pr4 reduct"><span class="smcap">Fiona Macleod</span>.</p>

<p class="p1">Early in 1897 Mr. Yeats wrote from Paris to F. M.
concerning aims and ideals he was endeavouring to shape
into expression for the re-vivifying of Celtic Ireland,
and out of which has evolved the Irish National Theatre:</p>

<p class="pn1"><span class="smcap">My dear Miss Macleod</span>,</p>

<div class="pbq">
<p>I owe you a letter for a long time, and can only promise
to amend and be more prompt in future. I have had a
busy autumn, always trying to make myself do more work
than my disposition will permit, and at such times I am
the worst of correspondents. I have just finished a certain
speech in <i>The Shadowy Waters</i>, my new poem, and
have gone to <i>The Café du Musée de Cluny</i> to smoke and
read the Irish news in the <i>Times</i>. I should say I wrote
about your book of poems as you will have seen in the
<i>Bookman</i>. I have just now a plan I want to ask you
about? Our Irish Literary and Political literary organisations
are pretty complete (I am trying to start a Young
Ireland Society, among the Irish here in Paris at the
moment) and I think it would be very possible to get up
Celtic plays through these Societies. They would be far
more effective than lectures and might do more than
anything else we can do to make the Irish Scotch and
other Celts recognise their solidarity. My own plays are
too elaborate, I think, for a start, and have also the disadvantage
that I cannot urge my own work in committee.
If we have one or two short direct prose plays, of (say)
a mythological and folklore kind, by you and by some
writer (I may be able to move O’Grady, I have already<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
spoken to him about it urgently) I feel sure we could get
the <i>Irish Literary Society</i> to make a start. They have
indeed for some time talked of doing my <i>Land of Heart’s
Desire.</i>
My own theory of poetical or legendary drama is
that it should have no realistic, or elaborate, but only
a symbolic and decorative setting. A forest, for instance,
should be represented by a forest pattern and not
by a forest painting. One should design a scene, which
would be an accompaniment not a reflection of the text.
This method would have the further advantage of being
fairly cheap, and altogether novel. The acting should
have an equivalent distance to that of the play from common
realities. The plays might be almost, in some cases,
modern mystery plays. Your <i>Last Supper</i>, for instance,
would make such a play, while your story in <i>The Savoy</i>
would arrange as a strong play of merely human tragedy.
I shall try my own hand possibly at some short prose
plays also, but not yet. I merely suggest these things
because they are a good deal on my mind, and not that I
wish to burden your already full hands. My “Shadowy
Waters” is magical and mystical beyond anything I have
done. It goes but slowly however, and I have had to recast
all I did in Ireland some years ago. Mr. Sharp
heard some of it in London in its first very monotonous
form. I wish to make it a kind of grave ecstasy.</p>

<p>I am also at the start of a novel which moves between
the Islands of Aran and Paris, and shall have to go again
to Aran about it. After these books I start a long cherished
project&mdash;a poetical version of the great Celtic epic
tale Deirdre, Cuchullin at the Ford, and Cuchullin’s
death, and Dermot and Grainne. I have some hopes that
Mr. Sharp will come to Paris on his way back to England.
I have much to talk over with him, I am feeling more and
more every day that our Celtic movement is approaching
a new phase. Our instrument is sufficiently prepared as
far as Ireland is concerned, but the people are less so,
and they can only be stirred by the imagination of a very
few acting on all.</p>

<p>My book <i>The Secret Rose</i> was to have been out in December
but it has been postponed till February. If I
have any earlier copies you shall have one. I am specially
curious to know what you think of a story called
“The Adoration of the Magi” which is a half prophecy
of a very veiled kind.</p></div>

<p class="pr6 reduct">Yours truly,</p>
<p class="pr4 reduct"><span class="smcap">W. B. Yeats</span>.<br /></p>

<p class="p1">The prolonged strain of the heavy dual work added to
by an eager experimentation with certain psychic phenomena
with which he had long been familiar but wished
further to investigate, efforts in which at times he and
Mr. W. B. Yeats collaborated&mdash;began to tell heavily on
him, and to produce very disquieting symptoms of nervous
collapse. We decided therefore that he should pass
the dead months of the year, as he called December and
January, in the South of France. From St. Remy while
on a visit to Mr. and Mrs. Janvier he wrote to me:</p>

<div class="pbq">
<p class="p1">“I am not going to lament that even the desire to
think-out anything has left me&mdash;much less the wish to
write&mdash;for I am sure that is all in the order of the day
towards betterness. But I do now fully realise that I
must give up everything to getting back my old buoyancy
and nervous strength&mdash;and that prolonged rest and
open air are the paramount needs....</p>

<p>However, enough of this, henceforth I hope to have to
think of and report on the up-wave only.</p>

<p>I am seated in a little room close to the window&mdash;and
as I look out I first see the boughs of a gigantic sycamore
through which the mistral is roaring with a noise
like a gale at sea. Beyond this is a line of cypresses, and
apparently within a stone’s throw are the extraordinary
wildly fantastic mountain-peaks of St. Remy. I have
never seen anything like them. No wonder they are
called the Dolomites of France. They are, too, in aspect
unspeakably ancient and remote.</p>

<p>We are practically in the country, and in every way,
with its hill-air and beauty, the change from Tarascon is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
most welcome.... There is a strange but singularly
fascinating blend of north and south here just now. The
roar of the mistral has a wild wintry sound, and the hissing
of the wood fire is also suggestive of the north: and
then outside there are the unmistakable signs of the south
and those fantastic unreal like hills. I never so fully
recognise how intensely northern I am than when I am
in the south....”</p></div>

<p class="p1">The following fragment of a diary&mdash;all there is for
1897&mdash;gives a record of the work he had in progress: also
shows his way of noting (or not noting!) his outgoing expenses:</p>

<div class="pbq">
<p class="p1"><i>January 1st, 1897.</i>&mdash;A day of extreme beauty at
Sainte-Maxime (Var). In the morning wrote letters etc.,
and then walked into Sainte-Maxime and posted them,
and sent a telegram to Elizabeth, to be delivered at dinner
time, with New Year greetings and Fair Wishes.</p>

<p>Worked at “Ahez the Pale,” and, having finished the
revision of it from first to last, did it up with “The
Archer,” and then sent (with long letter of general instructions
about the re-issue of F. M.’s tales in 3 vols.,
Spiritual Tales, Barbaric Tales, and Tragic Romances)
to Lilian Rea, at the Outlook Tower.</p>

<p>After dinner went a long walk by the sea. Noticed a
peculiarity by which tho’ the sea was dead calm, and on
the eastern side of the littoral of Ste. Maxime made
hardly a ripple, the noise on the further side was like
that of a rushing train or of a wind among pinewoods.
I walked round, and found oily waves beating heavily on
the shore. Tidal, possibly. Expenses today: Letters
3.90, Telegrams 5.90, Poor Man 30. Board &amp;c., at hotel.</p>

<p class="pc">Total&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;”&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;”.</p></div>

<p class="p1">After his return to London he wrote to Mrs. Janvier:</p>

<p class="pr5 p1 reduct"><span class="smcap">Grosvenor Club</span>,</p>
<p class="pr4 reduct">March 10, 1897.</p>

<p class="pbq">... Although I have had an unpleasant mental and
physical set-back the last three days, I am steadily<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
(at least I hope so) gaining ground&mdash;but I have never
yet regained the health or spirits I was in at St. Remy,
tho’ even there far more worn in mind and body than
even <i>you</i> guessed. But with the spring I shall get well.</p>

<p class="pbq">I am heart and soul with Greece in this war of race
and freedom&mdash;and consider the so-called “Concert” a
mockery and a sham. It is a huge Capitalist and Reactionary
Bogus Company. Fortunately the tide of indignation
is daily rising here&mdash;and even the Conservative
papers are at one with the Liberal on the central
points. Were I a younger man&mdash;or rather were I free&mdash;I
would now be in Greece or on my way to join the
Hellenes. As you will see by enclosed, I am one of the
authors who have sent a special message to the Athenian
President of the Chamber. It is a stirring time, and in
many ways....</p>

<p class="pbqr">March 22d.</p>

<div class="pbq">
<p>... What a whirl of excitement life is, just now. I
am all on fire about the iniquities of this Turkish-Finance
triumph over honour, chivalry, and the old-time
sense that the world <i>can</i> be well lost. There are many
other matters, too, for deep excitement&mdash;international,
national, literary, artistic, personal. It is the season of
sap, of the young life, of green fire. Heart-pulses are
throbbing to the full: brains are effervescing under the
strong ferment of the wine of life: the spiral flames of
the spirit and the red flower of the flesh are fanned and
consumed and recreated and fanned anew every hour
of every day....</p>

<p>This is going to be a strange year in many ways: a year
of spiritual flames moving to and fro, of wild vicissitudes
for many souls and for the forces that move through the
minds of men. The West will redden in a new light&mdash;the
‘west’ of the forlorn peoples who congregate among our
isles in Ireland&mdash;‘the West’ of the dispeopled mind.</p>

<p>The common Soul is open&mdash;one can see certain shadows
and lights as though in a mirror.... [The letter
ends abruptly.]</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1">Towards the end of April I went to Paris to write upon
the two “Salons,” and my husband, still very unwell,
went to St. Margaret’s Bay, whence he wrote to me:</p>

<div class="pbq p1">
<p>Sunday (on the shore by the sea, and in the sunshine).
I wonder what you are doing today? I feel very
near you in spirit as I always do when I have been reading,
hearing, or seeing any beautiful thing&mdash;and this forenoon
I have done all three, for I am looking upon the
beauty of sunlit wind-swept sea, all pale green and white,
and upon the deep blue sky above the white cliffs, upon
the jackdaws and gulls dense black or snowy against the
azure, upon the green life along and up the cliff-face,
upon the yellow-green cystus bushes below&mdash;and am listening
to the sough of the wind, soft and balmy, and the
rush and break of the sunlit waves among the pebbly
reaches just beyond me&mdash;and have been reading Maeterlinck’s
two essays, “The Deeper Life” and “The Inner
Beauty.”</p>

<p>I am longing to be regularly at work again&mdash;and now
feel as if at last I can do so....</p>

<p>More and more absolutely, in one sense, are W. S. and
F. M. becoming two persons&mdash;often married in mind and
one nature, but often absolutely distinct. I am filled with
a passion of dream and work....</p>

<p>Friendship, deepening into serene and beautiful flame,
is one of the most ennobling and lovely influences the
world has....</p></div>

<p class="pbqr"><span class="smcap">Wilfion.</span></p>

<p class="pbq">P. S. Again some more good tidings. Constables have
accepted my giving up <i>The Lily Leven</i> indefinitely&mdash;and
instead have agreed to my proposal to write a child’s
book (dealing with the Celtic Wonderworld) to be called
<i>The Laughter of Peterkin</i>....</p>

<p class="p1">From Paris I went to St. Remy for a short visit to
our friends the Janviers, and my birthday found me still
there. My husband had been considerably perplexed how<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
he was to celebrate the day for me from a distance. On
the early morning of the 17th of May the waiter brought
me my coffee and my letters to my room as usual, and
told me gravely that a large packet had arrived for me,
during the night, with orders that it should not be delivered
to me till the morning. Should it be brought up
stairs? The next moment the door was pushed open and
in came the radiant smiling unexpected apparition of
my Poet! In a little town an event of this sort is soon
known to everyone, and that evening when he and I went
for a walk, and sauntered through the little boulevards,
we found we were watched for and greeted by everyone,
and heads were popped out of windows just to see “les
amants.”</p>

<p>After his equally rapid return to town he wrote to me:</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“It seems very strange to be here and at work again&mdash;or
rather it is the interlude that seems so strange and
dreamlike. This time last week it was not quite certain
if I could get away, as it depended partly upon finishing
the Maeterlinck Essay and partly upon the postponement
of due date for the monograph on Orchardson.
Then Richard Whiteing came in. Then at last I said
that since fortune wouldn’t hurry up it could go to the
devil&mdash;and I would just go to my dear wife: and so I
went. And all is well. Only a week ago today since I
left! How dramatic it all is&mdash;that hurried journey, the
long afternoon and night journey from Paris, the long
afternoon and night journey to Tarascon&mdash;the drive
at dawn and sunrise through beautiful Provence&mdash;the
meeting you&mdash;the seeing our dear friends there again.
And then that restful Sunday, that lovely birthday!”</p>

<p class="p1">And again a few days later:</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“Herewith my typed copy of your Wilfion’s last writing.
Called ‘The Wayfarer’ though possibly, afterwards,
‘Where God is, there is Light,’ it is one of the
three Spiritual Moralities of which you know two already,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
‘The Fisher of Men’ and ‘The Last Supper.’ In another
way, the same profound truth is emphasised as in
the other two&mdash;that Love is the basic law of spiritual life.
‘The Redeemer liveth’ in these three: Compassion,
Beauty, Love&mdash;the three chords on which these three
harmonies of Fiona’s inner life have been born....”</p>

<p class="p1">“The Wayfarer” was published in <i>Cosmopolis</i>, and
afterwards included in <i>The Winged Destiny</i>.</p>

<p>On the 10th of June the author went for a night to Burford
Bridge, in order to have some talks with George
Meredith. While there he began to write “<i>The Glory of
the King</i>,” and two days later he finished it on reaching
home.</p>

<p>In the summer of 1897 he visited Ireland for the
first time. In Dublin he met Mr. George Russell&mdash;whose
beautiful verse was first published over the initials
A. E.&mdash;Mr. Standish O’Grady and other writers with
whom he had been in correspondence; and he greatly
enjoyed a visit to Mr. Edward Martin at Tillyra Castle
in Galway.</p>

<p>Among several enthusiastic letters I received the following:</p>

<div class="pbq">
<p class="p1">... I find it almost impossible to attempt to tell you
the varied and beautiful delights of this lovely place.
... The country is strange and fascinating&mdash;at once so
austere, so remote, so unusual, and so characteristic....</p>

<p>Lord Morris, and Martin and I go off today “to show
me the beauties of the wild coast of Clare.” It is glorious
autumnal weather, with unclouded sky, and I am
looking forward to the trip immensely. We leave at 11,
and drive to Ardrahan, and there get a train southward
into County Clare, and at Ennis catch a little loopline to
the coast. Then for two hours we drive to the famous
Cliffs of Moher, gigantic precipices facing the Atlantic&mdash;and
then for two hours move round the wild headlands
of Blackhead&mdash;and so, in the afternoon, to the beautiful
Clare ‘spa’ of Lisdoonvarna, where we dine late and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
sleep. Next day we return by some famous Round Tower
of antiquity, whose name I have forgotten. Another day
soon we are to go into Galway, and to the Aran Isles.</p>

<p>On Thursday Yeats arrives, also Dr. Douglas Hyde,
and possibly Standish O’Grady&mdash;and Lady Gregory, one
of the moving spirits in this projected new Celtic Drama.
She is my host’s nearest neighbour, and has a lovely place
(Coole Park) about five miles southwest from here, near
Gort. I drove there, with Sir N. G. yesterday, in a car,
through a strange fascinating austere country.</p>

<p>The people here are distinct from any I have seen&mdash;and
the women in particular are very striking with their
great dark eyes, and lovely complexions and their picturesque
‘snoods.’</p>

<p>The accent is not very marked, and the voices are low
and pleasant, and the people courteous to a high degree.</p>

<p>In the evening we had music&mdash;and so ended delightfully
my first delightful day in the west....</p>

<p>I forgot to tell you that I arrived late&mdash;and of course
at Athenry only&mdash;some 14 miles from here. I had to wait
some time till a car could be got&mdash;and what a drive I
had! The man said that “Plaze God, he would have me
at Tull-lyra before the gintry had given me up entoirely”&mdash;and
he was as good as his word! The night was dark,
and the roads near Athenry awful after the recent gale
and rains&mdash;and it was no joke to hold on to the car.
Whenever we came to a particularly bad bit (and I declared
afterwards that he took some of the stone dykes
at a leap) he cried&mdash;“Now thin yer honour, whin I cry
<i>Whiroo!</i> you hould on an’ trust to God”&mdash;and then came
his wild <i>Whiroo!</i> and the horse seemed to spring from the
car, and the jarvey and I to be flying alongside, and my
rope-bound luggage to be kicking against the stars&mdash;and
then we came down with a thud, and when I had a gasp of
refound breath I asked if the road was as smooth and
easy all the way, whereat my friend laughed genially and
said “Be aisy at that now&mdash;shure we’re coming to the bad
bit soon!” ...</p>

<p>Not far from here is a fairy-doctor, I am going to see<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
him some day. It is strange that when one day Lady
Gregory took one of Russell’s mystical drawings (I think
of the Mōr Reega) and showed it to an old woman, she
at once exclaimed that that was the “photograph” of the
fairy queen she had often seen, only that the strange
girdle of fan-flame was round her waist and not on her
head as in the drawing. An old man here also has often
met “the secret people,” and when asked to describe one
strange “fairy lord” he has encountered more than once,
it was so like G. R’s drawing that that was shown him
among several others, and he at once picked it out!</p>

<p>It is a haunted land.</p></div>

<p class="pr6 reduct">In haste (and hunger),</p>
<p class="pr4 reduct"><span class="smcap">Wilf</span>.</p>

<div class="pbq">
<p>P. S. I have been thinking much over my long-projected
consecutive work (i. e. as W. S.)&mdash;in five sequel
books&mdash;on the drama of life as seen in the evolution of
the dreams of youth&mdash;begun, indeed, over ten years ago
in Paris&mdash;but presciently foregone till ten maturing years
should pass.</p>

<p>But now the time has come when I may, and should,
and indeed, now, <i>must</i>, write this <i>Epic of Youth</i>. That
will be its general collective name&mdash;and it will interest
you to know the now definitely fixt names of these five
(and all very long) books; each to be distinct and complete
in itself, yet all sequently connected: and organic
and in the true sense dramatic evolution of some seven
central types of men and women from youth to maturity
and climax, along the high and low, levels.</p>

<p class="pi2">Name: <i>The Epic of Youth.</i><br />
I. The Hunters of Wisdom.<br />
II. The Tyranny of Dreams.<br />
III. The Star of Fortune.<br />
IV. The Daughters of Vengeance.<br />
V. The Iron Gates.</p>

<p>This will take five years to do&mdash;so it is a big task to set,
before the end of 1902!&mdash;especially as I have other work
to do, and F. M.’s, herself as ambitious. But method, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
maturer power and thought, can accomplish with far
less nervous output, what otherwise was impossible, and
only at a killing or at least perilous strain.</p>

<p>So wish me well!</p></div>

<p class="p1">But the pressure of health, of the needs of daily livelihood,
and of the more dominating ambitions of F. M.
prevented the fulfilment of this scheme.</p>

<p>Many times he talked of it, drafted out portions of it&mdash;but
it remained unaccomplished, and all that exists of it
is the beginning chapters of the first book written in
Paris ten years before, and then called <i>Cæsar of France</i>.</p>

<p>London proved to be impossible to him owing to the excitable
condition of his brain. Therefore he took rooms
in Hastings whence he wrote to me:</p>


<p class="pbqr p1">Nov. 21, 1897.</p>

<div class="pbq">
<p>I am so glad to be here, in this sunlight by the sea.
Light and motion&mdash;what a joy these are. The eyes become
devitalised in the pall of London gloom....</p>

<p>There is a glorious amplitude of light. The mind
bathes in these illimitable vistas. Wind and Wave and
Sun: how regenerative these elder brothers are.</p>

<p>Solomon says there is no delight like wisdom, and that
wisdom is the heritage of age: but there is a divine unwisdom
which is the heritage of youth&mdash;and I would
rather be young for a year than wise for a cycle. There
are some who live without the pulse of youth in the
mind: on the day, in the hour, I no longer feel that quick
pulse, I will go out like a blown flame. To be young;
to keep young: that is the story and despair of life....</p></div>

<p class="p1">Among the Christmas publications of 1897 appeared
<i>The Laughter of Peterkin</i> by Fiona Macleod. This book,
issued by Messrs. Archibald Constable and illustrated by
Mr. Sunderland Rollinson, was a new departure for the
author, an interlude in the midst of more strenuous original
work, for it was the re-telling of three old tales of
Celtic Wonderland: “The Four White Swans,” or “The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
Children of Lir,” “The Fate of the Sons of Turenn,” and
“Darthool and the Sons of Usna.”</p>

<p>Some years later, after the publication of Lady Gregory’s
“Gods and Fighting Men,” Mr. Alfred Nutt wrote
to F. M. and suggested that she should again turn her attention
to the re-telling of some of the beautiful old
Celtic tales and legends. My husband, however, realised
that he had far more dreams haunting the chambers of
his mind than he could have time to give expression to.
Therefore, very regretfully, he felt constrained to forego
what otherwise would have been a work of love.</p>

<div class="break">

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XIX</h2>

<p class="pch">WIVES IN EXILE</p>

<p class="pc"><i>Silence Farm</i></p>

<p class="p2">The production of the Fiona Macleod work was accomplished
at a heavy cost to the author as that side of his
nature deepened and became dominant. The strain upon
his energies was excessive: not only from the necessity
of giving expression to the two sides of his nature; but
because of his desire, that, while under the cloak of secrecy
F. M. should develop and grow, the reputation
of William Sharp should at the same time be maintained.
Moreover each of the two natures had its own needs and
desires, interests and friends. The needs of each were
not always harmonious one with the other, but created
a complex condition that led to a severe nervous collapse.
The immediate result of the illness was to cause an acute
depression and restlessness that necessitated a continual
change of environment. In the early part of 1898 he went
in turn to Dover, to Bournemouth, Brighton, and St. Margaret’s
Bay. He was much alone, except for the occasional
visit of an intimate friend; for I could go to him at
the week-ends only, as I had the work in London to attend
to. The sea, and solitude, however, proved his best
allies.</p>

<p>To Mrs. Janvier he wrote:</p>

<p class="pbq p1">... I am skirting the wood of shadows. I am filled
with vague fears&mdash;and yet a clear triumphant laughter
goes through it, though whether of life or death no one
knows. I am also in a duel with other forces than those
of human wills&mdash;and I need all my courage and strength.
At the moment I have recovered my physic control over
certain media. It cannot last more than a few days<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
at most a few weeks at a time: but in that time <i>I am
myself</i>....</p>

<p class="pbq">Let there be peace in your heart: peace and hope transmuted
into joy: in your mind, the dusking of no shadow,
the menace of no gloom, but light, energy, full life: and to
you in your whole being, the pulse of youth, the flame of
green fire....</p>

<p class="p1">At the end of April he wrote to R. Murray Gilchrist
from St. Margaret’s Bay:</p>

<p class="pn1"><span class="smcap">My dear Friend</span>,</p>

<p class="pbq">I know you will have been sorry to hear that I have
been ill&mdash;and had to leave work, and home. The immediate
cause was a severe and sudden attack of influenza
which went to membranes of the head and brain, and all
but resulted in brain fever. This evil was averted&mdash;but
it and the possible collapse of your friend Will were at
one time, and for some days, an imminent probability.</p>

<p class="pbq">I have now been a fortnight in this quiet sea-haven,
and am practically myself again. Part of my work is
now too hopelessly in arrears ever to catch up. Fortunately,
our friend Miss F. M. practically finished her
book just before she got ill too&mdash;and there is a likelihood
that <i>There is But One Love</i> [published in the following
year under the title of <i>The Dominion of Dreams</i>] will
come out this Spring. A few days will decide....</p>

<p class="pr6 reduct">Your friend and Sunlover,</p>
<p class="pbqn" style="padding-left: 12em;">(in the deep sense you know I mean&mdash;for I
have suffered much, but am now again fronting
life gravely and with laughing eyes),</p>
<p class="pr6 reduct"><span class="smcap">Will</span>.</p>

<p class="pn1">and again after his return to London:</p>

<p class="pbqr p1"><span class="smcap">Rutland House.</span></p>

<p class="pn"><span class="smcap">My dear Robert</span>,</p>

<div class="pbq">
<p>... After months of sickness, at one time at the
gates of death, I am whirled back from the Iron Gates
and am in the maelstrom again&mdash;fighting with mind and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
soul and body for that inevitable losing game which we
call victory. Well, the hour waits: and for good or ill I
put forth that which is in me. The Utmost for the Highest.
There is that motto for all faithful failures....</p>

<p>I am busy of course. And so, too, our friend F. M.&mdash;with
an elixir of too potent life. The flame is best: and
the keener, the less obscured of smoke. So I believe:
upon this I build. <i>Cosmopolis</i> will ere long have “The
Wayfarer” of hers&mdash;<i>Good Words</i> “The Wells of Peace”&mdash;<i>Harpers</i>,
something&mdash;<i>Literature</i> a spiritual ballad&mdash;and
so forth. But her life thought is in another and
stranger thing than she has done yet.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> ... Your
friend W. S. is busy too, with new and deeper and
stronger work. The fugitive powers impel. I look
eagerly to new work of yours: above all to what you
colour with yourself. I care little for anything that is not
quick with that volatile part of one which is the effluence
of the spirit within. Write to me soon: by return best of
all. You can help me&mdash;as I, I hope, can help <i>you</i>.</p>

<p>It is only the fullest and richest lives that know what
the <i>heart</i> of loneliness is.</p>

<p>You are my comrade, and have my love,</p></div>

<p class="pbqr"><span class="smcap">Will.</span></p>

<p class="p1">Two, among the many letters he wrote to me during
that Spring&mdash;so full of suffering for him and anxiety for
me&mdash;are, I think, very indicative of the two phases of his
nature. The first relates to views we held in common;
the second gives an insight into the primitive elemental
soul that so often swayed him, and his work.</p>

<p class="pbqr p1">March 29, 1898.</p>

<div class="pbq">
<p>... Yes, in essentials, we are all at one. We have
both learned and unlearned so much, and we have come to
see that we are wrought mysteriously by forces beyond
ourselves, but in so seeing we know that there is a great
and deep love that conquers even disillusion and disappointment....</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span></p>

<p>Not all the wishing, not all the dreaming, not all the
will and hope and prayer we summon can alter that
within us which is stronger than ourselves. This is a
hard lesson to learn for all of us, and most for a woman.
We are brought up within such an atmosphere of conventional
untruth to life that most people never even perceive
the hopeless futility in the arbitrary ideals which
are imposed upon us&mdash;and the result for the deeper natures,
endless tragic miscarriage of love, peace, and hope.
But, fortunately, those of us who to our own suffering
<i>do</i> see only too clearly, can still strike out a nobler ideal&mdash;one
that does not shrink from the deepest responsibilities
and yet can so widen and deepen the heart and spirit
with love that what else would be irremediable pain can
be transmuted into hope, into peace, and even into joy.</p>

<p>People talk much of this and that frailty or this or that
circumstance as being among the commonest disintegrants
of happiness. But far more fatal for many of us
is that supreme disintegrant, the Tyranny of Love&mdash;the
love which is forever demanding <i>as its due</i> that which is
wholly independent of bonds, which is as the wind which
bloweth where it listeth or where it is impelled, by the
Spirit. We are taught such hopeless lies. And so men
and women start life with ideals which seem fair, but are
radically consumptive: ideals that are not only bound to
perish, but that could not survive. The man of fifty who
could be the same as he was at twenty is simply a man
whose mental and spiritual life stopped short while he
was yet a youth. The woman of forty who could have
the same outlook on life as the girl of 19 or 20 would
never have been other than one ignominiously deceived
or hopelessly self-sophisticated. This ought not to be&mdash;but
it must be as long as young men and women are fed
mentally and spiritually upon the foolish and cowardly
lies of a false and corrupt conventionalism.</p>

<p>No wonder that so many fine natures, men and women,
are wrought to lifelong suffering. They are started with
impossible ideals: and while some can never learn that
their unhappiness is the result, not of the falling short<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
of others, but of the falsity of those ideals which they
had so cherished&mdash;and while others learn first strength to
endure the transmutations and then power to weld these
to far nobler and finer uses and ends&mdash;for both there is
suffering. Yet, even of that we make too much. We
have all a tendency to nurse grief. The brooding spirit
craves for the sunlight, but it will not leave the shadows.
Often, <i>Sorrow</i> is our best ally.</p>

<p>The other night, tired, I fell asleep on my sofa. I
dreamed that a beautiful spirit was standing beside me.
He said: “My Brother, I have come to give you the supreme
gift that will heal you and save you.” I answered
eagerly: “Give it me&mdash;what is it?” And the fair radiant
spirit smiled with beautiful solemn eyes, and blew a
breath into the tangled garden of my heart&mdash;and when I
looked there I saw the tall white Flower of Sorrow growing
in the Sunlight.”</p></div>

<p class="pr5 p1 reduct"><span class="smcap">St. Margaret’s Bay</span>,</p>
<p class="pr4 reduct">May, 1898.</p>

<div class="pbq">
<p>I have had a very happy and peaceful afternoon. The
isolation, with sun and wind, were together like soft
cream upon my nerves: and I suppose that within twenty
minutes after I left the station I was not only serenely at
peace with the world in general, but had not a perturbing
thought. To be alone, alone ‘in the open’ above all, is
not merely healing to me but an imperative necessity of
my life&mdash;and the chief counter agent to the sap that almost
every person exercises on me, unless obviated by
frequent and radical interruption.</p>

<p>By the time I had passed through the village I was
already ‘remote’ in dreams and thoughts and poignant
outer enjoyment of the lovely actualities of sun and wind
and the green life: and when I came to my favourite coign
where, sheltered from the bite of the wind, I could overlook
the sea (a mass of lovely, radiant, amethyst-shadowed,
foam-swept water), I lay down for two restful
happy hours <i>in which not once a thought of London or of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
any one in it, or of any one living</i>, came to me. This
power of living absolutely in the moment is worth not
only a crown and all that a crown could give, but is the
secret of youth, the secret of life.</p>

<p>O how weary I am of the endless recurrence of the
ordinary in the lives of most people&mdash;the beloved routine,
the cherished monotonies, the treasured certainties.
I grudge them to none: they seem incidental to the common
weal: indeed they seem even made for happiness.
But I know one wild heart at least to whom life must come
otherwise, or not at all.</p>

<p>Today I took a little green leaf o’ thorn. I looked at
the sun through it, and a dazzle came into my brain&mdash;and
I wished, ah I wished I were a youth once more, and was
‘sun-brother’ and ‘star-brother’ again&mdash;to lie down at
night, smelling the earth, and rise at dawn, smelling the
new air out of the East, and know enough of men and
cities to avoid both, and to consider little any gods ancient
or modern, knowing well that there is only ‘The
Red God’ to think of, he who lives and laughs in the red
blood....</p>

<p>There is a fever of the ‘green life’ in my veins&mdash;below
all the ordinary littlenesses of conventional life and all
the common place of exterior: a fever that makes me ill
at ease with people, even those I care for, that fills me
with a weariness beyond words and a nostalgia for sweet
impossible things.</p>

<p>This can be met in several ways&mdash;chiefly and best by
the practical yoking of the imagination to the active mind&mdash;in
a word, to work. If I can do this, well and good,
either by forced absorption in contrary work (e. g. Cæsar
of France), or by letting that go for the time and let the
more creative instinct have free play: or by some radical
change of environment: or again by some irresponsible
and incalculable variation of work and brief day-absences.</p>

<p>At the moment, I am like a man of the hills held in fee:
I am willing to keep my bond, to earn my wage, to hold to
the foreseen: and yet any moment a kestrel may fly overhead,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
mocking me with a rock-echo, where only sun and
wind and bracken live&mdash;or an eddy of wind may have the
sough of a pine in it&mdash;and then, in a flash&mdash;there’s my
swift brain-dazzle in answer, and all the rapid falling
away of these stupid half-realities, and only a wild instinct
to go to my own....</p></div>

<p class="p1">It was in this mood that he wrote to a friend:</p>

<p class="pbq p1">... but then, life is just like that. It is glad only
‘in the open,’ and beautiful only because of its dreams. I
wish I could live all my hours out of doors: I envy no one
in the world so much as the red deer, the eagle, the sea-mew.
I am sure no kings have so royal a life as the plovers
and curlews have. All these have freedom, rejoice
continually on the wind’s wing, exalt alike in sun and
shade: to them day is day, and night is night, and there is
nothing else.</p>

<p class="p1">His sense of recovery was greatly heightened by a delightful
little wander in Holland in May, with Mr.
Thomas A. Janvier, a jovial, breezy companion. Of all
he saw the chief fascination proved to be Eiland Marken,
as he wrote to me:</p>

<div class="pbq">
<p class="p1">We are now in the south Zuyder Zee, with marvellous
sky effects, and low lines of land in the distance. Looking
back at Eiland Marken one sees six clusters of houses,
at wide intervals, dropped casually into the sea.</p>

<p>We had a delightful time in that quaintest of old
world places, where the women are grotesque, the men
grotesquer, and the children grotesquest&mdash;as for the
tubby, capped, gorgeous-garbed, blue-eyed, yellow-haired,
imperturbable babies, they alone are worth coming to
see....</p></div>

<p class="p1">The following is a letter from his other self:</p>

<p class="pbqr p1">23d July, 1898.</p>

<p class="pn"><span class="smcap">My dear Mr. Rhys</span>,</p>

<p class="pbq">On my coming to Edinburgh for a few days I find the
book you have so kindly sent to me. It is none the less
welcome because it comes as no new acquaintance: for on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
its appearance a friend we have in common sent it to me.
Alas, that copy lies among the sea-weed in a remote
Highland loch; for the book, while still reading in part,
slipped overboard the small yacht in which I was sailing,
and with it the MS. of a short story of mine appropriately
named “Beneath the Shadow of the Wave”! The two
may have comforted each other in that solitude: or the
tides may have carried them southward, and tossed them
now to the Pembroke Stacks, now to the cliffs of Howth.
Perhaps a Welsh crab may now be squeaking (they do
say that crabs make a whistling squeak!) with a Gaelic
accent, or the deep-sea congers be reciting Welsh ballads
to the young-lady-eels of the Hebrides. Believe me, your
book has given me singular pleasure. I find in it the indescribable:
and to me that is one of the tests, perhaps the
supreme test (for it involves so much) of imaginative literature.
A nimble air of the hills is there; the rustle of
remote woods; the morning cry, that is so ancient, and
that still so thrills us.</p>

<p class="pbq">I most eagerly hope that you will recreate in beauty the
all but lost beauty of the old Cymric singers. There is a
true originality in this, as in anything else. The green
leaf, the grey wave, the mountain wind&mdash;after all, are
they not murmurous in the old Celtic poets, whether Alban
or Irish or Welsh: and to translate, and recreate
anew, from these, is but to bring back into the world
again a lost wandering beauty of hill-wind or green leaf
or grey wave. There is, I take it, no one living who could
interpret Davyth ap Gwilym and other old Welsh singers
as you could do. I long to have the Green Book of ‘the
Poet of the Leaves’ in English verse, and in English
verse such as that into which you could transform
it....</p>

<p class="pbqr">F. M.</p>

<p class="p1">The Welsh poet replied:</p>

<p class="pr5 p1 reduct"><span class="smcap">Newcastle-on-Tyne</span>,</p>
<p class="pr4 reduct">27th Dec., 1898.</p>

<p class="pn"><span class="smcap">Dear “Fiona Macleod,”</span></p>

<p class="pbq">‘I believe I never wrote to thank you for your story in
the <i>Dome</i>, which I read eventually in an old Welsh tower.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
It was the right place to read such a fantasy of the dark
and bright blindness of the Celt: and I found it, if not of
your very best, yet full of imaginative stimulus.</p>

<p class="pbq">Not many weeks ago, in very different surroundings,
Mr. Sharp read me a poem&mdash;two poems&mdash;of yours. So
I feel that I have the sense, at least, of your continued
journeys thro’ the divine and earthly regions of the Gael,
and how life looks to you, and what colours it wears.
What should we do were it not for that sense of the little
group of simple and faithful souls, who love the clay of
earth because heaven is wrapt in it, and stand by and support
their lonely fellows in the struggle against the forces
upon forces the world sends against them? I trust at
some time it may be my great good fortune to see you
and talk of these things, and hear more of your doings.</p>

<p class="pbqr"><span class="smcap">Ernest Rhys.</span></p>

<p class="p1">From the little rock-perched, sea-girt Pettycur Inn,
my husband wrote to Mrs. Janvier:</p>

<p class="pr5 p1 reduct"><span class="smcap">The House of Dreams</span>,</p>
<p class="pr4 reduct">20th Dec., 1898.</p>

<div class="pbq">
<p>... It has been a memorable time here. I have written
some of my best work&mdash;including two or three of
the new things for <i>The Dominion of Dreams</i>&mdash;viz. “The
Rose of Flame,” “Honey of the Wild Bees,” and “The
Secrets of the Night.”</p>

<p>What a glorious day it has been. The most beautiful
I have ever seen at Pettycur I think. Cloudless blue sky,
clear exquisite air tho’ cold, with a marvellous golden
light in the afternoon. Arthur’s Seat, the Crags and the
Castle and the 14 ranges of the Pentlands all clear-cut
as steel, and the city itself visible in fluent golden light.
The whole coast-line purple blue, down to Berwick Law
and the Bass Rock, and the Isle of May 16 miles out in the
north sea.</p>

<p>And now I listen to the gathering of the tidal waters
under the stars. There is an infinite solemnity&mdash;a hush,
something sacred and wonderful. A benediction lies upon
the world. Far off I hear the roaming wind. Thoughts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
and memories crowd in on me. Here I have lived and
suffered&mdash;here I have touched the heights&mdash;here I have
done my best. And now, here, I am going through a new
birth.</p>

<p>‘<i>Sic itur ad astral!</i>’</p></div>

<p class="p1">During the years that F. M. developed so rapidly her
creator felt the necessity pressing hard on him to sustain,
as far as he could, the reputation of W. S. He valued
such reputation as he had and was anxious not to let it
die away; yet there was a great difference in the method
of production of the two kinds of work. The F. M. writing
was the result of an inner impulsion, he wrote because
he had to give expression to himself whether the
impulse grew out of pain or out of pleasure. But W. S.,
divorced as much as could be from his twin self, wrote
because he cared to, because the necessities of life demanded
it. He was always deeply interested in his critical
work, for he was a constant student of Literature in
all its forms, and of the Literature of different countries&mdash;in
particular of France, America and Italy. This form
of study, this keen interest, was a necessity to W. S.;
but fiction was to him a matter of choice. He deliberately
set himself to write the two novels <i>Wives in Exile</i> and
<i>Silence Farm</i>, because he felt W. S. ought to produce
some such work as a normal procedure and development;
and also he felt it imperative to show some result of the
seclusion he was known to seek for purposes of work. He
was deeply interested in both books. <i>Wives in Exile</i> was
the easier to write, as it gave an outlet to the vein of
whimsicality in him, to his love of fun. He delighted in
the weaving of any plot, or in any extravaganza. The
book was a great relief and rest to him and was a real
tonic to his mind.</p>

<p>A little later, when he realised that something more
was expected of him and was too ill to attempt anything
in the shape of comedy, he therefore set himself to write
a tragic tale of the Lowlands, founded on a true incident.
Into this he put serious interested work, but there was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
one consideration that throughout had a restraining effect
on him&mdash;he never forgot that the book should not
have obvious kinship to the work of F. M., that he
should keep a considerable amount of himself in check.
For there was a midway method, that was a blending of
the two, a swaying from the one to the other, which he
desired to avoid, since he knew that many of the critics
were on the watch. Therefore, he strained the realistic
treatment beyond what he otherwise would have done,
in order to preserve a special method of presentment.
Nevertheless, that book was the one he liked best of all
the W. S. efforts, and he considered that it contained
some of his most satisfactory work. <i>Wives in Exile</i> was
published in June of 1896 by Mr. Grant Richards, and
<i>Silence Farm</i> in 1897.</p>

<p>The following letter from Mr. Theodore Watts-Dunton
was a great pleasure. It is, I believe, the only written
expression of what the author terms the “inwardness of
<i>Aylwin</i>”:</p>


<p class="pr5 p1 reduct"><span class="smcap">The Pines, Putney Hill</span>,</p>
<p class="pr4 reduct">Oct. 19, 1898.</p>

<p class="pn"><span class="smcap">My dear Sharp</span>,</p>

<div class="pbq">
<p>I had no idea that you were in England, and had no
means of finding your address.</p>

<p>You read only a portion of <i>Aylwin</i>&mdash;as far, I think,
as the discovery that Winifred had been the model of
Wilderspin. I always intended to send you other portions,
but procrastination ruined my good intentions.
You and my dear friend Mrs. Sharp were very kind to it,
I remember, and this encourages me to hope that when
you come to read it in its entirety, you will like it better
than ever. Although it is of course primarily a love-story,
and, as such, will be read by the majority of readers,
it is intended to be the pronouncement of something
like a new gospel&mdash;the gospel of love as the great power
which stands up and confronts a materialistic cosmogony
and challenges it and conquers it. This gospel of course
is more fully expressed in “The Coming of Love” of
which I send you a copy. “The Coming of Love” is of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
course a sequel to <i>Aylwin</i>, although, for certain reasons,
it preceded in publication the novel. <i>Aylwin</i> appears
in the last year of the present century, and I had a
certain object in delaying it for a little while longer
because I believe that should it have more than an ephemeral
existence as to which I am of course very doubtful,
it will appeal fifty years hence to fifty people where it
now only appeals to one. I cannot think that, when a man
has felt the love-passion as deeply as Aylwin feels it, he
will find it possible, whatever physical science may prove,
to accept a materialistic theory of the universe. He
must either commit suicide or become a maniac....
Henry Aylwin and Percy Aylwin, the Tarno Rye of “The
Coming of Love,” spring from the same Romany ancestors
and they inherited therefore the most passionate
blood in the Western World. Each of them is driven to a
peculiar spiritualistic cosmogony by the love of a girl&mdash;Winifred
Wynne and Rhona Boswell, though the two
girls are the exact opposite of each other in temperament.</p>

<p>But you really must let me get a glimpse of you somehow
before you leave England again.</p></div>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XX</h2>

<p class="pch">THE DOMINION OF DREAMS</p>

<p>For the January number of <i>The Fortnightly Review</i>
for 1899 “Fiona” wrote a long study on “A Group of
Celtic Writers” and what she held to be “the real Celticism.”
The writers specially noted are W. B. Yeats,
Dr. Douglas Hyde, George Russell (A. E.), Nora Hopper,
Katherine Tynan Hinkson, and Lionel Johnson. With
regard to the Celtic Revival the writer considered that
“there has been of late too much looseness of phrase
concerning the Celtic spirit, the Celtic movement, and
that mysterious entity Celticism. The ‘Celtic Renascence,’
the ‘Gaelic glamour,’ these, for the most part,
are shibboleths of the journalist who if asked what it is
that is being re-born, or what differentiating qualities
has the distinction of Gaelic from any other ‘glamour,’
or what constitutes ‘glamour’ itself, would as we say
in the North, be fair taken aback.... What is called
‘the Celtic Renascence’ is simply a fresh development of
creative energy coloured by nationality, and moulded by
inherited forces, a development diverted from the common
way by accident of race and temperament. The
Celtic writer is the writer the temper of whose mind is
more ancient, more primitive, and in a sense more natural
than that of his compatriot in whom the Teutonic
strain prevails. The Celt is always remembering; the
Anglo Saxon has little patience which lies far behind
or far beyond his own hour. And as the Celt comes of a
people who grew in spiritual outlook as they began what
has been revealed to us by history as a ceaseless losing
battle, so the Teuton comes of a people who has lost in
the spiritual life what they have gained in the moral and
the practical&mdash;and I use moral in its literal and proper
sense. The difference is a far greater one than may be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
recognised readily. The immediate divergence is, that
with the Celt ancestral memory and ancestral instinct
constitute a distinguishable factor in his life and his
expression of life, and that with his Teutonic compatriot
vision, dream, actuality and outlook, are in the main restricted
to what in the past has direct bearing upon the
present, and to what in the future is also along the line
of direct relation to the present.... All that the
new generation of Celtic or Anglo-Celtic (for the most
part Anglo-Celtic) writers hold in conscious aim, is to
interpret anew ‘the beauty at the heart of things,’ not
along the line of English tradition but along that of racial
instinct, coloured and informed by individual temperament.”</p>

<p class="p2">Naturally the article was favourably commented upon
in Ireland. The immediate result in the English press
was the appearance in <i>The Daily Chronicle</i> of January
28th of a long unsigned article entitled “Who is Fiona
Macleod: A Study in two styles” to suggest that in
response to the cry of “Author!” so repeatedly made,
“we may, in our search for Miss Macleod, turn to Mr.
William Sharp himself and say with literal truth ‘Thou
art beside thyself!’”</p>

<p>The writer advanced many proofs in support of his
contention, drawn from a close study of the writings and
methods of work of W. S. and F. M.; and asked, in conclusion:
“Will Mr. Sharp deny that he is identical with
Miss Macleod? That Miss Macleod is Mr. Sharp, I, for
one, have not a lingering doubt and I congratulate the
latter on the success, the real magic and strength of the
work issued under his assumed name.” At first the harassed
author ignored the challenge; but a few months
later F. M. yielded to the persuasion of her publishers&mdash;who
had a book of hers in the press&mdash;and wrote a disclaimer
which appeared in <i>The Literary World</i> and elsewhere.</p>

<p>In April 1899 <i>The Dominion of Dreams</i> was published
by Messrs. A. Constable &amp; Co.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span></p>

<p>To Mr. Frank Rinder the author wrote:</p>

<p class="pn1"><span class="smcap">My dear Frank</span>,</p>

<div class="pbq">
<p>Today I got three or four copies of <i>The Dominion of
Dreams</i>. I wish you to have one, for this book is at once
the deepest and most intimate that F. M. has written.</p>

<p>Too much of it is born out of incurable heartache, “the
nostalgia for impossible things.” ... My hope is that
the issues of life have been woven to beauty, for its
own sake, and in divers ways to reach and help or enrich
other lives.... “The Wells of Peace” must, I
think, appeal to many tired souls, spiritually athirst.
That is a clue to the whole book&mdash;or all but the more
impersonal part of it, such as the four opening stories
and “The Herdsman”; this is at once my solace, my
hope and my ideal. If ever a book (in the deeper portion
of it) came out of the depths of a life it is this: and so,
I suppose it shall live&mdash;for by a mysterious law, only the
work of suffering, or great joy, survives, and that in degree
to its intensity....</p>

<p>F. M.’s influence is now steadily deepening and, thank
God, along the lines I have hoped and dreamed....
In the writings to come I hope a deeper and richer and
truer note of inward joy and spiritual hope will be the
living influence. In one of the stories in this book, “The
Distant Country” occurs a sentence that is to be inscribed
on my gravestone when my time comes.</p>

<p>“Love is more great than we conceive and Death is the
keeper of unknown redemptions.”</p></div>

<p class="pr6 reduct">Lovingly,</p>
<p class="pr4 reduct"><span class="smcap">Will</span>.</p>

<p class="p1">To another correspondent he wrote:</p>

<p class="pbq p1">... Well, if it gains wide and sincere appreciation
I shall be glad: if it should practically be ignored I shall
be sorry: but, beyond that, I am indifferent. I know
what I have tried to do: I know what I have done: I know
the end to which I work: I believe in the sowers who will
sow and the reapers who will reap, from some seed of
the spirit in this book: and knowing this, I have little heed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
of any other considerations. Beauty, in itself, for itself,
is my dream: and in some expression of it, in the difficult
and subtle art of words, I have a passionate absorption.”</p>

<p class="p1">In a letter to Mr. Macleay W. S. explained that Fiona’s
new book is the logical outcome of the others: the deeper
note, the <i>vox humana</i>, of these. I think it is more than
merely likely that <i>this</i> is the last book of its kind. I
have had to live my books&mdash;and so must follow an inward
law&mdash;that is truth to art as well as to life I think.
There is, however, a miscellaneous volume (of ‘appreciations,’
and mystical studies) and also a poetic volume
which I suppose should be classed with it. I imagine
that, thereafter, her development will be on unexpected
lines, both in fiction and the drama: judging both from
what I know and what I have seen. In every sense I
think you are right when you speak of ‘surprise’ as an
element in what we may expect from her.... I suppose
some of that confounded controversy about Miss M.
and myself will begin again....</p>

<p class="p2">To Mr. W. B. Yeats the author wrote about the book,
and described our plans for the summer:</p>

<p class="pbqr p1">Monday, 1899.</p>

<p class="pn"><span class="smcap">My dear Yeats</span>,</p>

<p class="pbq">... As you well know, all imaginative work is truly
alive only when it has died into the mind and been born
again. The mystery of dissolution is the common mean
of growth. Resurrection is the test of any spiritual idea&mdash;as
of the spiritual life itself, of art, and of any final
expression of the inward life.... I have been ill&mdash;and
seriously&mdash;but am now better, though I have to be
careful still. All our plans for Scandinavia in the autumn
are now over&mdash;partly by doctor’s orders, who says
I must have hill and sea air native to me&mdash;Scotland or
Ireland. So about the end of July my wife and I intend
to go to Ireland. It will probably be to the east coast,
Mourne Mountains coast. I hope you like <i>The Dominion
of Dreams</i>. Miss Macleod has received two or three very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
strange and moving letters from strangers, as well as
others. The book of course can appeal to few&mdash;that is,
much of it. But, I hope, it will sink deep. We leave our
flat about 20th of July. Shall you be in town before then?
I doubt if I’ll ever live in London again. It is not likely.
I do not know that I am overwhelmingly anxious to live
anywhere. I think you know enough of me to know how
profoundly I feel the strain of life&mdash;the strain of double
life. Still, there is much to be done yet. But for
that ...</p>

<p class="pr6 reduct">Your friend,</p>
<p class="pr4 reduct"><span class="smcap">William Sharp</span>.</p>

<p class="p1">Mr. Yeats’ Review of <i>The Dominion of Dreams</i> in the
<i>Bookman</i> (July 1899) was carefully critical; it was his desire
“to discover the thoughts about which her thoughts
are woven. Other writers are busy with the way men
and women act in joy and sorrow, but Miss Macleod has
rediscovered the art of the mythmaker and gives a visible
shape to joys and sorrows, and makes them seem realities
and men and women illusions. It was minds like hers
that created Aphrodite out of love and the foam of the
sea, and Prometheus out of human thought and its likeness
to the leaping fire.” And then he pointed out that
“every inspiration has its besetting sin, and perhaps
those who are at the beginning of movements have no
models and no traditional restraints. She has faults
enough to ruin an ordinary writer. Her search for these
resemblances brings her beyond the borders of coherence....
The bent of nature that makes her turn from
circumstance and personalities to symbols and personifications
may perhaps leave her liable to an obsession for
certain emotional words which have for her a kind of
symbolic meaning, but her love of old tales should tell
her that the old mysteries are best told in simple words.”</p>

<p>At first this criticism caused the author much emotional
perturbation; but later, when he reconsidered the statements,
he admitted that there was reason for the censure.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span></p>

<p>“Fiona” then asked the Irish poet to indicate the passages
he took most exception to, and Mr. Yeats sent a
carefully annotated copy of the book under discussion.
And I may add that a number of the revisions that differentiate
the version in the Collected Edition from the original
issue are the outcome of this criticism. The author’s
acknowledgment is dated the 16th September 1899:</p>

<p class="pn1"><span class="smcap">My dear Mr. Yeats</span>,</p>

<div class="pbq">
<p>I am at present like one of those equinoctial leaves
which are whirling before me as I write, now this way
and now that: for I am, just now, addressless, and drift
between East and West, with round-the-compass eddies,
including a flying visit of a day or two in a yacht from
Cantyre to North Antrim coast....</p>

<p>I am interested in what you write about <i>The Dominion
of Dreams</i> and shall examine with closest attention all
your suggestions. The book has already been in great
part revised by my friend. In a few textual changes in
“Dalua” he has in one notable instance followed your
suggestion about the too literary “lamentable elder
voices.” The order is slightly changed too: for “The
House of Sand and Foam” is to be withdrawn and
“Lost” is to come after “Dalua” and precede “The
Yellow Moonrock.”</p>

<p>You will like to know what I most care for myself.
From a standpoint of literary art <i>per se</i> I think the best
work is that wherein the barbaric (the old Gaelic or Celto-Scandinavian)
note occurs. My three favourite tales in
this kind are “The Sad Queen” in <i>The Dominion of
Dreams</i>, “The Laughter of Scathach” in <i>The Washer of
the Ford</i>, and “The Harping of Cravetheen” in <i>The Sin-Eater</i>.
In art, I think “Dalua” and “The Sad Queen”
and “Enya of the Dark Eyes” the best of <i>The Dominion
of Dreams</i>.</p>

<p><i>Temperamentally</i>, those which appeal to me are those
with the play of mysterious psychic forces in them....
as in “Alasdair the Proud,” “Children of the Dark
Star,” “Enya of the Dark Eyes,” and in the earlier<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
tales “Cravetheen,” “The Dan-nan-Ron,” and the Iona
tales.</p>

<p>Those others which are full of the individual note of
suffering and other emotion I find it very difficult to
judge. Of one thing only I am convinced, as is my friend
(an opinion shared by the rare few whose judgment really
means much), that there is nothing in <i>The Dominion of
Dreams</i>, or elsewhere in these writings under my name, to
stand beside <i>The Distant Country</i> ... as the deepest
and most searching utterance on the mystery of passion....
It is indeed the core of all these writings ... and
will outlast them all.</p>

<p>Of course I am speaking for myself only. As for my
friend, his heart is in the ancient world and his mind for
ever questing in the domain of the spirit. I think he cares
little for anything but through the remembering imagination
to recall and interpret, and through the formative
and penetrative imagination to discover certain mysteries
of psychological and spiritual life.</p>

<p>Apropos&mdash;I wish very much you would read, when it
appears in the <i>Fortnightly Review</i>&mdash;probably either in
October or November&mdash;the spiritual ‘essay’ called “The
Divine Adventure”&mdash;an imaginative effort to reach the
same vital problems of spiritual life along the separate
yet inevitably interrelated lines of the Body, the Will
(Mind or Intellect) and the soul....</p>

<p>I have no time to write about the plays. Two are
typed: the third, the chief, is not yet finished. When all
are revised and ready, you can see them. “The Immortal
Hour” (the shortest, practically a one act play in
time) is in verse.</p></div>

<p class="pr6 reduct">Sincerely yours,</p>
<p class="pr4 reduct"><span class="smcap">Fiona Macleod</span>.</p>

<p class="p1">These two plays were finally entitled “The Immortal
Hour” and “The House of Usna.” The third, “The Enchanted
Valleys,” remains a fragment.</p>

<p>At midsummer we gave up our flat in South Hampstead
and stored our furniture indefinitely. It was decreed
that we were to live no more in London; so we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
decided to make the experiment of wintering at Chorleywood,
Bucks. Meanwhile, we went to our dear West
Highlands, to Loch Goil, to Corrie on Arran, and to Iona.
And in August we crossed over to Belfast and stayed for
a short time at Ballycastle, the north easterly point of
Ireland, to Newcastle, and then to Dublin.</p>

<p>From Ballycastle my husband wrote to Mrs. Janvier:</p>

<p class="pbqr p1">6th Aug., 1899.</p>

<p class="pbq">... We are glad to get away from Belfast, tho’ very
glad to be there, in a nice hotel, after our fatigues and
10 hours’ exposure in the damp sea-fog. It was a lovely
day in Belfast, and Elizabeth had her first experience
of an Irish car.</p>

<p class="pbq">We are on the shore of a beautiful bay&mdash;with the great
ram-shaped headland of Fair Head on the right, the Atlantic
in front, and also in front but leftward the remote
Gaelic island of Rathlin. It is the neighbourhood whence
Deirdrê and Naois fled from Concobar, and it is from a
haven in this coast that they sailed for Scotland. It is
an enchanted land for those who dream the old dreams:
though perhaps without magic or even appeal for those
who do not....”</p>

<p class="p1">October found us at Chorleywood, in rooms overlooking
the high common. Thence he wrote to Mr. Murray Gilchrist:</p>

<p class="pn1"><span class="smcap">My dear Robert</span>,</p>

<div class="pbq">
<p>It is a disappointment to us both that you are not coming
south immediately. Yes; the war-news saddens one,
and in many ways. Yet, the war was inevitable: of that
I am convinced, apart from political engineering or financial
interests. There are strifes as recurrent and inevitable
as tidal waves. Today I am acutely saddened by
the loss of a very dear friend, Grant Allen. I loved the
man&mdash;and admired the brilliant writer and catholic critic
and eager student. He was of a most winsome nature.
The world seems shrunken a bit more. As yet, I cannot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
realise I am not to see him again. Our hearts ache
for his wife&mdash;an ideal loveable woman&mdash;a dear friend of
us both.</p>

<p>We are both very busy. Elizabeth has now the artwork
to do for a London paper as well as for <i>The Glasgow
Herald</i>. For myself, in addition to a great complication
of work on hand I have undertaken (for financial
reasons) to do a big book on the Fine Arts in the Nineteenth
Century. I hope to begin on it Monday next. It is
to be about 125,000 words, (over 400 close-printed pp.),
and if possible is to be done by December-end!...</p>

<p>You see I am not so idle as you think me. It is likely
that our friend Miss Macleod will have a new book out in
January or thereabouts&mdash;but not fiction. It is a volume
of ‘Spiritual Essays’ etc.&mdash;studies in the spiritual history
of the Gael.</p>

<p>We like this most beautiful and bracing neighbourhood
greatly: and as we have pleasant artist-friends near, and
are so quickly and easily reached from London, we are as
little isolated as at So. Hampstead&mdash;personally, I wish
we were more! It has been the loveliest October I remember
for years. The equinoxial bloom is on every tree.
But today, after long drought, the weather has broken,
and a heavy rain has begun.</p></div>

<p class="p1">... <i>The Progress of Art in the Century</i> was a longer piece

the summer of 1900, and published in <i>The Nineteenth

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XXI</h2>

<p class="pch">THE DIVINE ADVENTURE</p>

<p class="pc2"><i>Celtic</i></p>


<p class="p2">In the early summer of 1900 the volume entitled <i>The
Divine Adventure: Iona: By Sundown Shores</i>, with a
dedication to me, was published by Messrs. Chapman &amp;
Hall.</p>

<p>Various titles had been discarded, among others “The
Reddening of the West,” also “The Sun-Treader” intended
for a story, projected but never written, to form a
sequel to “The Herdsman.” The titular essays had previously
appeared in various periodicals; the two first in
<i>The Fortnightly</i>. As the author explained in a letter to
Mr. Macleay, Fiona’s Highland champion:</p>


<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1">... There is a sudden departure from fiction ancient
or modern in something of mine that is coming out in
the November and December issues of <i>The Fortnightly
Review</i>.</p>

<p>“The Divine Adventure” it is called&mdash;though this
spiritual essay is more ‘remote,’ i. e. unconventional, and
in a sense more ‘mystical,’ than anything I have done.
But it is out of my inward life. It is an essential part of
a forthcoming book of spiritual and critical essays or
studies in the spiritual history of the Gael, to be called
<i>The Reddening of the West</i>....</p>

<p>A book I look forward to with singular interest is Mr.
Arthur Symon’s announced <i>Symbolist Movement in Literature</i>.</p>

<p>This is the longest letter I have written for&mdash;well, I
know not when. But, then, you are a good friend.</p></div>

<p class="pr6 reduct">Believe me, yours most sincerely,</p>
<p class="pr4 reduct"><span class="smcap">Fiona Macleod</span>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1">To Mons. Anatole Le Braz, the Breton romance-writer
and folklorist, F. M. had written previously:</p>

<p class="pn1"><span class="smcap">Dear M. Le Braz</span>,</p>

<div class="pbq">
<p>Your letter was a great pleasure to me. It was the
more welcome as coming from one who is not only an
author whose writings have a constant charm for me,
but as from a Celtic comrade and spiritual brother who
is also the foremost living exponent of the Breton genius.
It may interest you to know that I am preparing an
<i>étude</i> on Contemporary Breton (i. e. Franco-Breton) Literature;
which, however, will be largely occupied with
consideration of your own high achievement in prose and
verse.</p>

<p>It gives me sincere pleasure to send to you by this post
a copy of the ‘popular’ edition of Adamnan’s <i>Life of St.
Colum</i>&mdash;which please me by accepting. You will find,
below these primitive and often credulous legends of
Iona a beauty of thought and a certain poignant exquisiteness
of sentiment that cannot but appeal to you,
a Breton of the Bretons....</p>

<p>It seems to me that in writing the spiritual history of
Iona I am writing the spiritual history of the Gael, of all
our Celtic race. The lovely wonderful little island sometimes
appears to me as a wistful mortal, in his eyes the
pathos of infinite desires and inalienable ideals&mdash;sometimes
as a woman, beautiful, wild, sacred, inviolate, clad
in rags, but aureoled with the Rainbows of the west.</p>

<p>“Tell the story of Iona, and you go back to God, and
end in God.” (The first words of my ‘spiritual history’)....</p>

<p>But you will have already wearied of so long a letter.
My excuse is ... that you are Anatole Le Braz, and I
am your far-away but true comrade,</p></div>

<p class="pbqr"><span class="smcap">Fiona Macleod.</span></p>

<p class="p1">On the 30th Dec. W. S. wrote to Mr. Frank Rinder:</p>


<div class="pbq">
<p>Just a line, dear Frank, both as dear friend and literary
comrade, to greet you on New Year’s morning, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
to wish you health and prosperity in 1900. I would like
you very much to read some of this new Fiona work, especially
the opening pages of “Iona,” for they contain a
very deep and potent spiritual faith and hope, that has
been with me ever since, as there told, as a child of seven,
old Seumas Macleod (who taught me so much&mdash;was indeed
the <i>father</i> of Fiona)&mdash;took me on his knees one sundown
on the island of Eigg, and made me pray to “Her.”
I have never written anything mentally so spiritually
autobiographical. Strange as it may seem it is almost
all literal reproduction of actuality with only some dates
and names altered.</p>

<p>But enough about that troublesome F. M.!...</p></div>

<p class="p1">And to Mr. Gilchrist, “It was written <i>de profundis</i>,
partly because of a compelling spirit, partly to help
others passionately eager to obtain some light on this
most complex and intimate spiritual destiny.”</p>

<p>Some months previously William had written to an unknown
correspondent, Dr. John Goodchild, poet, mystic
and archeologist:</p>

<p class="pr6 p1 reduct"><span class="smcap">The Outlook Tower</span>,</p>
<p class="pr5 reduct"><span class="smcap">Edinburgh</span>,</p>
<p class="pr4 reduct">1898.</p>

<p class="pn"><span class="smcap">My dear Sir</span>,</p>

<div class="pbq">
<p>I have to thank you very cordially for your book and
the long and interesting letter which accompanied it. It
must be to you also that I am indebted for an unrevised
proof-copy of <i>The Light of the West</i>.</p>

<p>Everything connected with the study of the Celtic past
has an especial and deep interest for me, and there are
few if any periods more significant than that of the era
of St. Columba. His personality has charmed me, in
the old and right sense of the word ‘charm’: but I have
come to it, or it to me, not through books (though of
course largely through Adamnan) so much as through a
knowledge gained partly by reading, partly by legendary
love and hearsay, and mainly by much brooding on
these, and on every known saving and record of Colum,
in Iona itself. When I wrote certain of my writings (e. g.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
“Muime Chriosd” and “The Three Marvels of Iona”)
I felt, rightly or wrongly, as though I had in some measure
become interpretative of the spirit of “Colum the
White.”</p>

<p>Again, I have long had a conviction&mdash;partly an emotion
of the imagination, and partly a belief insensibly deduced
through a hundred avenues of knowledge and surmise&mdash;that
out of Iona is again to come a Divine Word,
that Iona, the little northern isle, will be as it were the
tongue in the mouth of the South.</p></div>

<p class="pr6 reduct">Believe me, sincerely yours,</p>
<p class="pr4 reduct"><span class="smcap">Fiona Macleod</span>.</p>

<p class="p1">“The House of Usna”&mdash;one of three Celtic plays, on
which F. M. had been working for several months, was
brought out under the auspices of The Stage Society, of
which William Sharp was the first Chairman. Mr. Frederick
Whelen, the founder of that Society, had met my
husband at Hindhead when we were staying with his
uncle and aunt, Mr. and Mrs. Grant Allen, at their charming
house, The Croft, built among the heather and the
pines on the hill-top just by the edge of the chasm called
“The Devil’s Punch Bowl.”</p>

<p>The older man was keenly interested in the project, did
his utmost to help towards its realisation. “The House
of Usna” was performed at the Fifth Meeting of the
Society at the Globe Theatre April 29th, 1900, together
with two short plays by Maeterlinck, <i>The Interior</i> and
<i>The Death of Tintagiles</i>. The music, composed especially
for the short drama in three scenes, was by Mr.
Y. M. Capel, and the play was produced under the direction
of Mr. Granville Barker. According to one critic:
“It had beauty and it had atmosphere, two very rare
things on the stage, but I did not feel that it quite made
a drama, or convince, as a drama should, by the continuous
action of inner or outer forces. It was, rather, passion
turning upon itself, and with no language but a cry.”</p>

<p>The author took the greatest interest in the rehearsals,
and in the performance. He thoroughly enjoyed the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
double play that was going on, as he moved about the
theatre, and chatted to his friends during the intervals,
with little heed of the risks he ran of detection of authorship.
The drama itself was printed three months later
in <i>The National Review</i>, and eventually published in book
form in America by Mr. T. B. Mosher, in 1903.</p>

<p>In 1900, too, the second of these dramas, “The Immortal
Hour,” appeared in the November number of <i>The
Fortnightly Review</i>. It was published posthumously in
England (Foulis) and in America (Mosher). The
third play, “The Enchanted Valleys,” was never finished.
It had been the author’s intention to publish these dramas
in book form under the third title, and to dedicate it to
Mr. W. L. Courtney, who, as Editor of the <i>Fortnightly</i>,
had been a good friend to Fiona Macleod.</p>

<p>To his unknown correspondent the dramatist wrote
again:</p>

<p class="pbqr p1">Nov. 15, 1900.</p>

<p class="pn"><span class="smcap">Dear Dr. Goodchild</span>,</p>

<div class="pbq">
<p>I am glad that you have found pleasure in <i>The Immortal
Hour</i>. I wonder if you interpret the myth of Midir
and Etain quite differently, or if you, too, find in Midir
the symbol of the voice of the other world; and what you
think of Dalua, the Fool, here and elsewhere. Your
earnest letter, written in spiritual comradeship, has been
read by me again and again. I do not say that the warning
in it is not justified, still less that it is not called for:
but, on the other hand, I do not think I follow you aright.
Is it something in <i>The Immortal Hour</i> (or in <i>The Divine
Adventure</i> or more likely <i>The Dominion of Dreams</i>) that
impelled you to write as you did: or something seemingly
implied, or inferred by you?...</p>

<p>We seldom know how or where we really stand, or the
mien and aspect we unwittingly bear to the grave eyes of
the gods. Is it the lust of knowledge, of Hidden Things,
of the Delight of the World, of the magic of Mother-Earth,
of the Flesh&mdash;to one or all&mdash;that you allude. The
matter touches me intimately.</p>

<p>You have (I had almost said mysteriously, but why so,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
for it would be more mysterious if there were no secret
help in spiritual comradeship) helped me at more than
one juncture in my life....</p></div>

<p class="pr6 reduct">Most sincerely,</p>
<p class="pr4 reduct"><span class="smcap">Fiona Macleod.</span></p>

<p class="p1">Dr. Goodchild replied:</p>

<p class="pr5 p1 reduct"><span class="smcap">Bordighera</span>,</p>
<p class="pr4 reduct">Nov. 29, 1900.</p>

<p class="pn"><span class="smcap">My dear Miss Macleod</span>,</p>

<div class="pbq">
<p>I left one or two of your questions unanswered in my
last. I am no Celtic scholar. It was your ‘Prayer of the
Women’ which suggested to me first how far you might
feel for your sisters, and how far you might journey to
find succour....</p>

<p>A woman who gazes into Columba’s Well and sees
how the bubbles burst on its surface, needs all her own
wisdom lest she be dizzy, and a hand held out from the
opposite side the spring may help her to gaze more
steadily. <i>Midhir</i>, I believe to be the same as the oriental
<i>Mitherd</i>, the Recipient of Light, and its translator in
the <i>Midhc-Myth</i>, A voice from the “Otherworld” as you
say, but the wearer of the <i>Miter</i>, speaking not from the
<i>Under</i>world, but the <i>Upper</i>world i.e. He is a High Priest
speaking in the full light of the Sun.</p>

<p><i>Etain</i> is difficult, and my own ideas by no means formulated.
I merely suggest that ere your Etain was born,
her name typified the strong hope of the singer, his immortality,
his knowledge that the Sun not merely creates
but re-creates in renewed beauty.</p>

<p>If you remember Cairbre, the son of Etain, you may
also remember those other Ethainn who sung before the
Ark in a far country. The Father is put on one side for
the Mother, by the singer, the Mother for the Bride.
Even Milton, puritan though he was, must invoke a
woman to the aid of “adventurous song” and is careful
not to change the sex when in the Muse of Sinni and Silva
is seen the Spirit of the Creator.</p>

<p>As regards Dalua, I know nothing of him by name except
what you yourself have written. Is there any connection<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
between the name and Dala (the Celtic) which is
sometimes found in company with Brat and Death, in
your Celtic genealogies?</p>

<p>At the same time I have dimly guessed all my life how
folly might be better than the wisdom of wise men, and
remembering dimly how much wiser I was myself as a
child than after I had grown up, I have incessantly desired
a return to that state of childish thought, and tried
to learn from children, when I had the chance, the secrets
of their folly which carried them so near to divinity, if
they were not hurried away from their vision by those
about them.</p></div>

<p class="pbqr">J. A. G.</p>

<p class="p1">The Essay entitled “Celtic” had originally appeared in
the <i>Contemporary Review</i> a few weeks before the publication
of the new volume, and had aroused considerable
comment. In Britain it was regarded as a clear statement
of the aims and ideas of the so-called Celtic Revival&mdash;(a
term which “F. M.” greatly disliked). It was
otherwise in Ireland, and naturally so, considering the
different conditions on both sides of the Irish channel out
of which the movement had grown. On this side political
considerations had not touched the question; it was
mainly concerned with the preservation of the old language,
with racial characteristic feelings, and their expression
in literature. On the other side of the water, the
workers had many more issues at heart than in the Highlands.
So the Highland Celt and the Irish Celts did not
quite understand one another; an animated correspondence
ensued in private and in the press. The Irish press
was divided in its opinion on ‘Celtic,’ because the writers
were not of one mind among themselves in their methods
of working towards the one end all Celts have at heart.
There were those, who being ardent Nationalists regarded
the Celtic literary movement as one with the political,
or as greatly coloured by it. This factor gave
a special element to the Irish phase of the movement
which sharply differentiated it from the movement in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>
Scotland, Wales or Brittany. Other workers were interested
in the movement as a whole, in each of the “six
Celtic Nations,” and “The Celtic Association” was
formed, with Lord Castletown at its head, with a view of
keeping each of the six branches of the movement in
touch with each other: the Irish, Scots, Welsh, Manx,
Breton, and Cornish or British. This Society desired to
make a Federation of these working sections an actuality,
and to that end decided to hold a Pan Celtic Congress
every three years. The first of these was held in
Dublin, and to it my husband subscribed as W. S. and
as F. M., though, as an obvious precaution against detection,
he did not attend it.</p>

<p>Opinion in Ireland was divided as to the value of such
a Federation; certain of the enthusiasts believed that
working for it drew strength and work away from the
central needs in Ireland. Another point of dispute was
the question of language; as to what did or would constitute
an Irish Literature&mdash;works written in the Erse
only; or all work, either in the Erse or the English tongue
that gave expression to and made vital the Celtic spirit
and aspirations. F. M. deplored the uniting of the political
element to the movement&mdash;and naturally had no
inclination towards any such feeling.</p>

<p>William Sharp’s great desire was that the Celtic spirit
should be kept alive, and be a moulding influence towards
the expression of the racial approach to and yearning
after spiritual beauty, whether expressed in Gaelic or in
the English tongue. He knew that there is a tendency,
with the young of those people in Scotland at least, to put
aside the beautiful old thoughts, or at all events their
outward expression, with the disuse of the older language
which had clothed those thoughts; he feared that to put
silence upon them would be to lose them after a generation
or two. Therefore it was his great hope that the
genius of the race would prove strong enough to express
itself in either language; and he realised that its influence
would be more potent and widespread if also it
found expression in the English language. Thus a misunderstanding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>
arose; one of approach to the subject
rather than in essentials.</p>

<p>The Irish Press was divided in opinion concerning
“Celtic,” especially <i>The Irish Independent</i>, <i>Freeman’s
Journal</i> and <i>All Ireland Review</i>. In the latter a correspondence
began. One writer welcomed the Essay as
coming from one “possessed, as no other writer of
our time is possessed, with a sense of the faculty and
mission of the Celt, and shows not only deep intuition
but the power to see life steadily and to see it as a
whole.”</p>

<p>“A. E.” however, was of another opinion. He considered
the essay to be out of place “in a book otherwise inspired
by the artist’s desire to shape in a beautiful way”;
to be semi-political and inaccurate as an expression of
the passionate aimes of the Irish Celt; and he took exception
to the expression of belief ‘there is no racial road
to beauty.’</p>

<p>F. M. replied and endeavoured to make more clear her
position; but without success, as a subsequent letter
from the Irish poet proved. Another writer showed that
there was obviously a confusion of two ideas between the
disputants&mdash;and Mr. T. W. Rolleston closed the discussion
with a letter in which he quietly pointed out the
misapprehensions on both sides and concluded with the
generous admission: “Fiona Macleod is most emphatically
a helper, not a hinderer in this work, and one of
the most potent we have. For my own part I think her
essay ‘Celtic’ indicates the lines on which we may most
successfully work.” William Sharp realised that since
his essay had given rise to misapprehension of his aims
and ideas, it would be well to further elucidate them;
that moreover, as “F. M.” wrote to Mr. Russell, “a truer
understanding has come to me in one or two points where
we have been at issue.” He, therefore, revised and enlarged
his essay, and, with an added Foreword of explanation,
had it published separately in America by Mr.
T. B. Mosher; and, finally, he included it in <i>The Winged
Destiny</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span></p>

<p>In the early autumn the following letter came to my
husband from overseas:</p>

<p class="pr4 reduct">Sept. 26, 1900.</p>

<p class="pn"><span class="smcap">My dearest Guilielmo</span>,</p>

<p class="pbq">In this last year of <i>my</i> Century, among my little and
exceptional attempts to celebrate my coming birthday&mdash;I
wish that you the most leal and loved of our English
friends, may receive for once a word from me before its
sun goes down. Probably you are in some Lodge of the
lake of your Northern Night, or off for the Mountains of
the Moon. Still, even your restless and untamed spirit
must by this time have been satisfied of wandering; at
any rate, I doubt not this will in the end find you somewhere,
and then you will know that my heart began to
go out to you as I neared another milestone ... it has
suffered enough and lost enough to make it yearn fondly
for the frank face and dear words of a kindred, though

<p class="p1">The “restless spirit” was by no means tired of wandering.
Partly owing to the insistence of circumstance,
partly from choice, we began that autumn a series of
wanderings that brought us back to London and to Scotland
for a few weeks only each summer. The climate of
England proved too severe; my husband had been seriously
ill in the New Year. Despite his appearance of
great vitality, his extraordinary power of recuperation
after every illness&mdash;which in a measure was due to his
buoyant nature, to his deliberate turning of his mind
away from suffering or from failure and “looking sunwise,”
to his endeavour to get the best out of whatever<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>
conditions he had to meet&mdash;we realised that a home in
England was no longer a possibility, that it would be
wise to make various experiments abroad rather than
attempt to settle anywhere permanently. Indeed, we
were both glad to have no plans, but to wander again how
and where inclination and possibilities dictated. Early
in October he wrote to Mr. Murray Gilchrist from London:</p>

<p class="pn1"><span class="smcap">My dear Robert</span>,</p>

<div class="pbq">
<p>A little ago, on sitting down in my club to answer some
urgent notes (and whence I now write) my heart leapt
with pleasure, and an undeserving stranger received Part
I of a beaming welcome&mdash;for the waiter announced that
“Mr. Gilchrist would like to see you, Sir.” Alas, it was
no dear Peaklander, but only a confounded interviewer
about the Stage Society!...</p>

<p>Elizabeth and I leave England on the morning of the
12th&mdash;and go first to the South of Provence, near Marseilles:
after Yule-tide we’ll go on to Italy, perhaps first
to Shelley’s Spezzia or to Pegli of the Orange Groves
near Genoa: and there we await you, or at furthest a little
later, say in Florence. We shall be away till the end of
March.</p>

<p>Meanwhile ‘tis all unpleasantness and incertitude:
much to do and little pleasure in the doing: a restlessness
too great to be salved short of departure, and the longed
for mental and nervous rest far away.</p>

<p>I have just returned from a flying visit to Dorset, and
saw Thomas Hardy. He is well, and at work: the two
happiest boons of fortune for all our kinship&mdash;and therein
I hope <i>you</i> are at one with him. I wish you could run
up and see our first Stage Society production this weekend
(Sunday) when we bring out a short play by Hardy
and R. L. Stevenson and Henley’s ‘Macaire.’ (I resigned
my Chairmanship but was re-elected: and so am extra
busy before I go.)</p></div>

<p class="pbq">P. S. Miss Macleod’s drama ‘The Immortal Hour’ is
in the November <i>Fortnightly</i>, also her article “The Gael

<p class="pbq">And in addition to these a study on the Dramas of

<p class="p1">To Mr. Macleay he sent an account of the work he had
on hand:</p>

<p class="pr5 p1 reduct"><span class="smcap">Aix-en-Provence</span>,</p>
<p class="pr4 reduct">30th Nov., 1900.</p>

<p class="pn"><span class="smcap">Dear Mr. Macleay</span>,</p>

<div class="pbq">
<p>Your friendly note has reached me here, where I have
been some time, this being my best centre in Provence at
this season for my special studies in Provencal literature
and history. My wife and I expect to remain here till
about Christmas time, and then to go on to Italy.</p>

<p>Pressure of urgent work&mdash;chiefly a lengthy volume on
the Evolution of the Fine Arts in the Nineteenth Century,
primarily for transatlantic publication&mdash;prevented my
being much in Scotland this autumn. I was a brief while
in Galloway visiting friends, and for a week or so at Portpatrick,
and a few days in Edinburgh&mdash;c’est tout.</p>

<p>At one time there was a chance that I might be near
Taynuilt, and I looked forward greatly to see Mr. Alexander
Carmichael again. He is a splendid type of the
true Highlander, and of a nature incomparably sweet and
refined&mdash;and I have the greatest admiration of him in all
ways....</p>

<p>A remarkable family, and I would to Heaven there
were more such families in the Highlands now. Yes,
<i>what</i> a book <i>Carmina Gadelica</i> is! It ought to become as
precious to the Scottish Gael as the Greek Anthology to
all who love the Hellenic ideal, but with a more poignant,
a more personal appeal.... I can’t tell you about Miss
Macleod’s historical romance for the good reason that
I don’t know anything about its present prospects myself.
Personally I regret the long postponement, as I think
(judging from what I have seen) that it would be a success<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>
as a romance of history. Miss Macleod, however,
became dissatisfied with what she had done, or its atmosphere,
or both, and has not touched it again for some
months past&mdash;though the last time she spoke of the subject
she said she hoped it would be ready by midsummer....
I am myself heavily engaged in work, including
many commissions. I’ve finished an essay on “Impressionism”
(“The Impressionist” I call it) for the
forthcoming new monthly, <i>The North Liberal Review</i>,
and am now in the throes of a long <i>Quarterly</i> article.
Then I have a Provencal book on hand, and (interlusive)
a Provencal romance.</p>

<p>You will, of course, keep all I have said of myself and
doings, and still more importantly of Miss Macleod, to
yourself. I don’t think she wants anyone save friends
and acquaintances to know that she is abroad, and for
her health. And above all needing rest as she is, she
dreads the slightest addition to a correspondence already
beyond her capacities.</p>

<p>Before I left London I read with deep interest the
opening instalments of Neil Munro’s new book <i>Doom
Castle</i>. It promises, I think, to be his <i>chef-d’&oelig;uvre</i>.</p>

<p>Write to me again soon, with news of your doings and
prospects.</p></div>

<p class="pr6 reduct">Yours sincerely,</p>
<p class="pr4 reduct"><span class="smcap">William Sharp</span>.</p>

<p class="p1">The Provencal romance that he was mentally projecting&mdash;the
never written <i>Gypsy Trail</i>&mdash;was in part to have
dealt with his early gipsy experiences. One among other
things which revived this strain of memory was our near
vicinage to Les Sainte-Maries, in Provence, where the
bones of Sarah, the gipsy servant of “les Maries,” are
enshrined; also he had recently read the vivid description
of the gathering of the gipsy tribes at that Shrine on her
Feast day, written by the Provencal novelist Jean Aicard,
in his <i>Le Roi des Camargues</i>.</p>

<p>During my husband’s first visit to Provence he had
been much interested in meeting certain members of Les<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span>
Félibres, the Provencal literary and linguistic Nationalists.
He visited Frederick Mistral in his charming country
home and noticed the similarity of physical type
shared by the Provencal and himself. I, also, was struck
by the likeness between the two men and thought that
Mistral might easily have passed for elder brother of
his Scots <i>confrère</i>. At Avignon we saw Madame Roumanille,
the sister of Felix Gras, and widow of one of the
founders of Les Félibres, and her poet-daughter, Térèse,
who inherited her father’s gift. At Aix we met Mistral’s
god-daughter Madame Marie Gasquet, daughter of the
poet M. Gerard, another of the original group of workers
in the old <i>Langue d’&OElig;uil</i>. Madame Gasquet was the
wife of the young poet, Joachim Gasquet, between whom
and my husband there grew up a warm friendship.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XXII</h2>

<p class="pch">PROVENCE</p>

<p class="pc"><i>Maniace</i></p>

<p class="p2">New Year’s Day found us at Palermo where my husband
was enchanted at being presented with a little pottle
of freshly gathered wild strawberries; a week later we
traversed the island to Taormina, whence he wrote to
Mrs. Janvier:</p>

<p class="pr5 p1 reduct"><span class="smcap">Monte Venere, Taormina</span>,</p>
<p class="pr4 reduct">25th Jan., 1901.</p>

<div class="pbq">
<p>... Today it was too warm to work contentedly indoors
even upon our little terrace with its superb views
over Etna and the Ionian Sea&mdash;so at 9 a.m. Elizabeth and
I, with a young painter-friend came up here to a divine
spot on the slopes of the steep and grand-shouldered Hill
of Venus, bringing with us our writing and sketching
materials and also fruit and wine and light luncheon. It
is now about 3 p.m. and we have lain here for hours in
the glorious warmth and cloudless sunglow&mdash;undisturbed
by any sounds save the soft sighing of the sea far below,
the fluttering of a young goatherd with his black flock on
a steep across a near ravine, and the occasional passing
of a muleteer or of a mountaineer with his wine-panier’d
donkeys. A vast sweep of sea is before us and beneath.
To the left, under the almond boughs, are the broad
straits which divide Sicily from Calabria&mdash;in front, the
limitless reach of the Greek sea&mdash;to the right, below, the
craggy heights and Monte Acropoli of Taormina&mdash;and,
beyond, the vast slope of snow-clad Etna....</p>

<p>I have just been reading (for the hundredth time) in
Theocritus. How doubly lovely he is, read on the spot.
That young shepherd fluting away to his goats at this
moment might be Daphnis himself. Three books are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span>
never far from here: Theocritus, the Greek Anthology,
and the Homeric Hymns. I loved them before: now they
are in my blood.</p>

<p>Legend has it that near this very spot Pythagoras used
to come and dream. How strange to think that one can
thus come in touch with two of the greatest men of antiquity&mdash;for
within reach from here (a pilgrimage to be
made from Syracuse) is the grave of Æschylus. Perhaps
it was here that Pythagoras learned the secret of
that music (for here both the sea-wind and the hill-wind
can be heard in magic meeting) by which one day&mdash;as told
in Iamblicus&mdash;he cured a young man of Taormina (Tauromenion)
who had become mad as a wild beast, with
love. Pythagoras, it is said, played an antique air upon
his flute, and the madness went from the youth....</p>

<p>I shall never forget the journey across Sicily. I forget
if I told you in my letter that it had been one of my
dreams since youth to read the Homeric Hymns and
Theocritus in Sicily&mdash;and it has been fulfilled: even to
the unlikeliest, which was to read the great Hymn to
Demeter at Enna itself. And that I did&mdash;in that wild and
remote mountain-land. Enna is now called Castrogiovanni&mdash;but
all else is unchanged&mdash;though the great temples
to Demeter and Persephone are laid low. It was a
wonderful mental experience to read that Hymn on the
very spot where Demeter went seeking&mdash;torch in hand,
and wind-blown blue peplos about her&mdash;her ravished
daughter, the beautiful Pherephata or Persephone.
However, I have already told you all about that&mdash;and the
strange coincidence of the two white doves, (which Elizabeth
witnessed at the moment I exclaimed) and about
our wonderful sunset-arrival in Greek Tauromenion....</p></div>

<p class="p1">To the same friend he described our visit to Syracuse:</p>

<p class="pr6 p1 reduct"><span class="smcap">Casa Politi</span>,</p>
<p class="pr5 reduct"><span class="smcap">Strada Dionysio</span>,</p>
<p class="pr4 reduct">7th Feb.,:01.</p>

<div class="pbq">
<p>... I must send you at least a brief line from Syracuse&mdash;that
marvellous ‘Glory of Hellas’ where ancient
Athens fell in ruin, alas, when Nicias lost here the whole<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span>
army and navy and Demosthenes surrendered by the
banks of the Anapus&mdash;the Syracuse of Theocritus you
love so well&mdash;the Syracuse where Pindar heard some of
his noblest odes sung, where Plato discoursed with his
disciples of New Hellas, where (long before) the Argonauts
had passed after hearing the Sirens singing by this
fatal shore, and near where Ulysses derided Polyphemus&mdash;and
where Æschylus lived so long and died.</p>

<p>It seems almost incredible when one is in the beautiful
little Greek Theatre up on the rising ground behind
modern Syracuse to believe that so many of the greatest
plays of the greatest Greek tragedians (many unknown
to us even by name) were given here under the direction
of Æschylus himself. And now I must tell you of a piece
of extraordinary good fortune. Yesterday turned out
the superbest of this year&mdash;a real late Spring day, with
the fields full of purple irises and asphodels and innumerable
flowers, and the swallows swooping beneath the
multitudes of flowering almonds. We spent an unforgettable
day&mdash;first going to the Castle of ancient Euryalos&mdash;perhaps
the most wonderful I have ever known.
Then, in the evening, I heard that today a special choral
performance was to be given in the beautiful hillside
Greek Theatre in honour of the visit of Prince Tommaso
(Duke of Genoa, the late King’s brother, and Admiral of
the Fleet). Imagine our delight! And <i>what</i> a day it has
been&mdash;the ancient Æschylean theatre crammed once
more on all its tiers with thousands of Syracusans, so
that not a spare seat was left&mdash;while three hundred young
voices sang a version of one of the choral sections of
“The Suppliants” of Æschylus&mdash;with it il Principe on
a scarlet dais where once the tyrant Dionysius sat! Over
head the deep blue sky, and beyond, the deep blue Ionian
sea. It was all too wonderful....</p></div>

<p class="p1">While we were at Taormina the news came of the death
of Queen Victoria. An impressive memorial service was
arranged by Mr. Albert Stopford, an English resident
there, and held in the English Chapel of Sta. Caterina.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span></p>

<p>To attend it the Hon. Alexander Nelson Hood came
from the “Nelson property” of Bronte where he was
wintering with his father, Viscount Bridport, Duke of
Bronte, who for forty years had been personal Lord in
Waiting to the Queen. To the son we were introduced
by Mr. Stopford; and a day or two later we started on
our first visit to that strange beautiful Duchy on Ætna,
that was to mean so much to us.</p>

<p>Greatly we enjoyed the experience&mdash;the journey in the
little Circum-Ætnean train along the great shoulder of
Etna, with its picturesque little towns and its great
stretches of devastating lava; the first sight of the Castle
of Maniace&mdash;in its shallow tree-clad valley of the Simeto
flanked by great solemn hills&mdash;as we turned down
the winding hill-road from the great lava plateau where
the station of Maletto stands; the time-worn quadrangular
convent-castle with its Norman chapel, and its great
Iona cross carved in lava erected in the court-yard to the
memory of Nelson; the many interesting relics of Nelson
within the castle, such as his Will signed Nelson and
Bronte on each page, medals, many fine line engravings
of the battles in which he, and also Admiral Hood, took
part; the beautiful Italian garden, and wild glen gardens
beyond. No less charming was the kindly welcome given
to us by the fine, hale old Courtier who&mdash;when his son one
afternoon had taken my husband for a drive to see the
hill-town of Bronte, and the magnificent views of and
from Ætna, with its crowning cover of snow&mdash;told me, as
we sat in the comfortable central hall before a blazing log
fire, many reminiscences of the beloved Queen he had
served so long.</p>

<p>In the spring we returned to England, through Italy;
and from Florence, where we took rooms for a month,
F. M. wrote to an unknown correspondent:</p>

<p class="pbqr p1">18th March, 1901.</p>

<p class="pn"><span class="smcap">My dear unknown friend</span>,</p>

<div class="pbq">
<p>You must forgive a tardy reply to your welcome letter,
but I have been ill, and am not yet strong. Your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span>
writing to me has made me happy. One gets many
letters: some leave one indifferent; some interest; a few
are like dear and familiar voices speaking in a new way,
or as from an obscure shore. Yours is of the last. I
am glad to know that something in what I have written
has coloured anew your own thought, or deepened the
subtle music that you yourself hear&mdash;for no one finds the
colour of life and the music of the spirit unless he or
she already perceive the one and love the other. Somewhere
in one of my books&mdash;I think in the latest, <i>The Divine
Adventure</i>, but at the moment cannot remember&mdash;I
say that I no longer ask of a book, is it clever, or striking,
or is it well done, or even is it beautiful, but&mdash;out of how
deep a life does it come. That is the most searching test.
And that is why I am grateful when one like yourself
writes to tell me that intimate thought and emotion
deeply felt have reached some other and kindred
spirit....</p>

<p>I am writing to you from Florence. You know it, perhaps?
The pale green Arno, the cream-white, irregular,
green-blinded, time-stained houses opposite, the tall cypresses
of the Palatine garden beyond, the dove-grey
sky, all seem to breathe one sigh ... <i>La Pace! L’Oblio!</i></p>

<p>But then&mdash;life has made those words “Peace,” “Forgetfulness,”
very sweet for me. Perhaps for you this
vague breath of another Florence than that which Baedeker
described might have some more joyous interpretation.
I hope so....</p>

<p>You are right in what you say, about the gulf between
kindred natures being less wide than it seems. But do
not speak of the spiritual life as “another life”: there
is no ‘other’ life: what we mean by that is with us now.
The great misconception of Death is that it is the only
door to another world.</p></div>

<p>The October number of <i>The Fortnightly Review</i> contained
a series of poems by F. M. entitled “The Ivory
Gate,” and at the same time an American edition of <i>From
the Hills of Dream</i>&mdash;altered from the original issue&mdash;was
published by Mr. T. Mosher, to whom the poet wrote
concerning the last section of the English Edition:</p>

<p class="pbqr p1">12th Nov., 1901.</p>

<p class="pn"><span class="smcap">Dear Mr. Mosher</span>,</p>

<div class="pbq">
<p>What a lovely book <i>Mimes</i> is! It is a pleasure to look
at it, to handle it. The simple beauty of the cover-design
charms me. And the contents ... yes, these are beautiful,
too.</p>

<p>I think the translation has been finely made, but there
are a few slips in interpretative translation, and (as
perhaps is inevitable) a lapse ever and again from the
subtle harmony, the peculiar musical undulant rhythm of
the original. In a <i>creative</i> translation, the faintest jar
can destroy the illusion: and more than once I was rudely
reminded that a foreigner mixt this far-carried honey
and myrrh. Yet this is only “a counsel of perfection,”
by one who perhaps dwells overmuch upon the ideal of
a flawless raiment for beautiful thought or dream. Nor
would I seem ungracious to a translator who has so
finely achieved a task almost as difficult as that set to
Liban by Oisin in the Land of the Ever-Living, when he
bade her take a wave from the shore and a green blade
from the grass and a leaf from a tree and the breath of
the wind and a man’s sigh and a woman’s thought, and
out of them all make an air that would be like the single
song of a bird. Do you wish to tempt me? Tempt me
then with a proposal as to “The Silence of Amor,” to be
brought out as Mimes is!</p>

<p>The short prose-poems would have to be materially
added to, of course: and the additions would for the
most part individually be longer than the short pieces you
know....</p></div>

<p class="pr6 reduct">Sincerely yours,</p>
<p class="pr4 reduct"><span class="smcap">Fiona Macleod</span>.</p>

<p class="p1">In sending a copy of the American edition of <i>From the
Hills of Dream</i> to Mr. Yeats, the author explained that,
though it contained new material,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span></p>

<div class="pbq">
<p class="p1">... there will be much in it familiar to you. But even
here there are changes which are recreative&mdash;as, for example,
in the instance of “The Moon-Child,” where one
or two touches and an added quatrain have made a poem
of what was merely poetic.</p>

<p>The first 10 poems are those which are in the current
October <i>Fortnightly Review</i>. But when these are reprinted
in a forthcoming volume of new verse ... it will
also contain some of the 40 ‘new’ poems now included in
this American edition, and the chief contents will be the
re-modelled and re-written poetic drama <i>The Immortal
Hour</i>, and with it many of the notes to which I alluded
when I wrote last to you. In the present little volume it
was not found possible to include the lengthy, intimate,
and somewhat esoteric notes: among which I account of
most interest for you those pertinent to the occult myths
embodied in <i>The Immortal Hour</i>.</p>

<p>You will see, however, that one or two dedicatory pages&mdash;intended
for the later English new book&mdash;have here
found a sectional place: and will, I hope, please you.</p></div>

<p class="pr8 reduct">Believe me,</p>
<p class="pr6 reduct">Your friend truly,</p>

<p class="p1">Mr. Yeats replied:</p>

<p class="pr5 p1 reduct"><span class="smcap">18 Woburn Buildings,</span></p>
<p class="pr4 reduct"><span class="smcap">London</span>, Saturday.</p>

<p class="pn"><span class="smcap">My dear Miss Macleod</span>,</p>

<div class="pbq">
<p>I have been a long while about thanking you for your
book of poems, but I have been shifting from Dublin to
London and very busy about various things&mdash;too busy for
any quiet reading. I have been running hither and
thither seeing people about one thing and another. But
now I am back in my rooms and have got things straight
enough to settle down at last to my usual routine. Yesterday
I began arranging under their various heads
some hitherto unsorted folk-stories on which I am about
to work, and today I have been busy over your book. I
never like your poetry as well as your prose, but here
and always you are a wonderful writer of myths. They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span>
seem your natural method of expressions. They are to
you what mere words are to others. I think this is
partly why I like you better in your prose, though now
and then a bit of verse comes well, rising up out of the
prose, in your simplest prose the most, the myths stand
out clearly, as something objective, as something well
born and independent. In your more elaborate prose
they seem subjective, an inner way of looking at things
assumed by a single mind. They have little independent
life and seem unique; your words bind them to you. If
Balzac had written with a very personal, very highly
coloured style, he would have always drowned his inventions
with himself. You seem to feel this, for when you
use elaborate words you invent with less conviction, with
less precision, with less delicacy than when you forget
everything but the myth. I will take as example, a prose
tale.</p>

<p>That beautiful story in which the child finds the Twelve
Apostles eating porridge in a cottage, is quite perfect in
all the first part, for then you think of nothing but the
myth, but it seems to me to fade to nothing in the latter
part. For in the latter part the words rise up between
you and the myth. You yourself begin to speak and we
forget the apostles, and the child and the plate and the
porridge. Or rather the more mortal part of you begins
to speak, the mere person, not the god. You, as I think,
should seek the delights of style in utter simplicity, in a
self-effacing rhythm and language; in an expression that
is like a tumbler of water rather than like a cup of wine.
I think that the power of your work in the future will depend
on your choosing this destiny. Certainly I am looking
forward to “The Laughter of the Queen.” I thought
your last prose, that pilgrimage of the soul and mind and
body to the Hills of Dream promised this simple style.
It had it indeed more than anything you have done.</p>

<p>To some extent I have an advantage over you in having
a very fierce nation to write for. I have to make
everything very hard and clear, as it were. It is like riding
a wild horse. If one’s hands fumble or one’s knees<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span>
loosen one is thrown. You have in the proper sense far
more imagination than I have and that makes your work
correspondingly more difficult. It is fairly easy for me,
who do so much of my work by the critical, rather than
the imaginative faculty, to be precise and simple, but it is
hard for you in whose mind images form themselves without
ceasing and are gone as quickly perhaps.</p>

<p>But I am sure that I am right. When you speak with
the obviously personal voice in your verse, or in your
essays you are not that Fiona who has invented a new
thing, a new literary method. You are that Fiona when
the great myths speak through you....</p></div>

<p class="pr6 reduct">Yours,</p>
<p class="pr4 reduct"><span class="smcap">W. B. Yeats</span>.</p>

<p class="pbq">I like your verses on Murias and like them the better
perhaps because of the curious coincidence that I did in
summer verses about lovers wandering ‘in long forgotten
Murias.’</p>

<p class="p1">During the spring William Sharp had prepared a volume
of selections from the poems of Swinburne, with an
Introduction by himself, for publication in the Tauchnitz
Collection of British Authors. Mr. Swinburne consented
that the selection should be made in accordance with the
critical taste of the Editor, with which however he was
not in complete agreement. He expressed his views in a
letter dated from The Pines, Putney Hill:</p>

<p class="pbqr">Oct. 6th.</p>

<p class="pn"><span class="smcap">Dear Mr. Sharp</span>,</p>

<p class="pbq">Many thanks for the early copy you have had the kindness
to send on to me. I am pleased to find the Nympholept
in a leading place, as I think it one of the best and
most representative things I ever did. I should have
preferred on all accounts that In the Bay had filled the
place you have allotted to Ave atque Vale, a poem to
which you are altogether too kind, in my opinion, as
others have been before you. I never had really much in
common with Baudelaire tho’ I retain all my early admiration<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span>
for his genius at its best. I wish there were
fewer of such very juvenile crudities as you have selected
from my first volume of poems: it is trying to
find such boyish attempts as The Sundew, Aholibah, Madonna
Mia, etc., offered as examples of the work of a
man who has written so many volumes since in which
there is nothing that is not at least better and riper than
they. I wish too that Mater Triumphalis had not been
separated from its fellow poem&mdash;a much fitter piece of
work to stand by itself. On the other hand, I am very
cordially obliged to you for giving the detached extract
from Anactoria. I should greatly have preferred that
extracts only should have been given from Atalanta in
Calydon, which sorely needs compression in the earlier
parts. Erectheus, which would have taken up so much
less space, would also, I venture to think, have been a
better and a fairer example of the author’s work. Mr.
Watts Dunton’s objections to the book is the omission
of Super Flumina Babylonis. I too am much surprised
to find it excluded from a selection which includes so
much that might well be spared&mdash;nay, would be better
away. I would like to have seen one of what I call my
topographical poems in full. The tiny scrap from Loch
Torridon was hardly worth giving by itself. I do not
understand what you find obscure or melancholy in The
Garden of Cymodoce. It was written simply to express
my constant delight in the recollection of Sark. I hope
you will not think anything in this note captious or ungracious.
Candour always seems to be the best expression
possible of gratitude or goodwill.</p>

<p class="p1">In December of 1901 F. M. wrote, ostensibly from
Argyll, to Dr. Goodchild: “I had hoped by this time to
have had some definite knowledge of what I am to do,
where to go this winter. But circumstances keep me
here.... Our friend, too (meaning himself as W. S.),
is kept to England by the illness of others. My plans<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span>
though turning upon different issues are to a great extent
dependent, later, on his....</p>

<p>I have much to do, and still more to think of, and it
may be bring to life through the mysterious resurrection
of the imagination.</p>

<p>What long months of preparation have to go to any
writing that contains life within it.&mdash;Even the slightest,
the most significant, as it seems! We, all of us who live
this dual life of the imagination and the spirit, do indeed
mysteriously conceive, and fare thereafter in weariness
and heaviness and long travail, only for one small uncertain
birth. It is the common law of the spirit&mdash;as
the obverse is the common law of womanhood.”</p>

<p class="p2">And again:</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“Life becomes more and more strange, complex, interwrought,
and <i>intentional</i>. But it is <i>the end</i> that matters&mdash;not
individuals.”</p>

<p class="p1">Owing to my Mother’s serious illness I could not leave
England early in November, as we had intended. London
was impossible for my husband for he, too, was ill.
At first he went to Hastings, whence he wrote to Mrs.
Philpot&mdash;author of <i>The Sacred Tree</i>:</p>

<p class="pr5 p1 reduct"><span class="smcap">Hastings</span>,</p>
<p class="pr4 reduct">Dec. 20, 1901.</p>

<p class="pn"><span class="smcap">My dear Friend</span>,</p>

<p class="pbq">You would have enjoyed “being me” yesterday. I had
a most delightful day at Rye with Henry James who
now lives there for many months in the year. I went
over early, lunched, and then we went all over that wonderfully
picturesque old Cinque Port. A lovely walk in
a frost-bound still country, and then back by the sombre
old Land Gate, over the misty marshes down below, and
the flame red Cypres Tower against a plum coloured
sunset, to Henry James’ quaint and picturesque old
house to tea. It was in every way a memorable and
delightful day, and not least the great pleasure of intercourse<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span>
with that vivid brilliant and alive mind. He is
as of course, <i>you</i> realise, an artist to the finger tips.
<i>Et ils sont rares ces diables d’esprit.</i> I wish it were
spring! I long to hear the missel thrush in the blossoming
pear tree: and the tingling of the sap, and the
laughter in the blood. I suppose we are all, all of us
ever dreaming of resurrections....</p>

<p class="p1">The English climate proved equally impossible, so W.
S. went to Bordighera to be near Dr. Goodchild. But he
was too restless to remain long anywhere, and moved
on to Rome and finally to Sicily. He wrote to Mr. Rhys
after the New Year from Il Castello di Maniace:</p>

<p class="pn1"><span class="smcap">My dear Ernest</span>,</p>

<p class="pbq">As I think I wrote to you, I fell ill with a form of
fever,&mdash;and had a brief if severe recurrence of it at
Rome: and so was glad some time ago to get on to my
beloved ‘Greek’ Taormina, where I rapidly ‘convalesced.’
A few days ago I came on here, to the wilds
inlands of the Sicilian Highlands, to spend a month with
my dear friend here, in this wonderful old ‘Castle-Fortress-Monastery-Mansion&mdash;the
Castel’ Maniace itself being
over 2,000 feet in the highlands beyond Etna, and
Maletto, the nearest station about 3,000.</p>

<p class="pbq">How you and Grace would rejoice in this region. Within
a day’s easy ride is Enna, sacred to Demeter, and about
a mile or so from Castel’ Maniace, in a wild desolate
region of a lava wilderness, is the lonely heron-haunted
moorland-lake wherein tradition has it Persephone disappeared....</p>

<p class="pbqr">W. S.</p>

<p class="p1">I joined him early in February at Maniace and we
remained with Mr. Hood for a month of sunshine and
flowers. Among other guests came Miss Maud Valerie
White. She was wishful that the pleasant days spent
there together should be commemorated, and proposed
that W. S. should write a short poem, that she would
set to Sicilian airs, and that the song should be dedicated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span>
to our host. To that end Mr. Hood summoned to the
Castello one of the peasant bagpipe players, who one
evening walked round and round the hall, playing the
airs that are played each Christmas by the pipers before
the shrines to the Madonna in the various churches. The
result of that evening was a song, “Buon’ Riposo,” written
by William Sharp, set to music by Miss Valerie
White, and published by Messrs. Chappell.</p>

<p class="pch">BUON RIPOSO</p>

<p class="ppn6">When, like a sleeping child</p>
<p class="ppn7">Or a bird in the nest,</p>
<p class="ppn6">The day is gathered</p>
<p class="ppn7">To the earth’s breast ...</p>
<p class="ppn6">Hush!... ‘tis the dream-wind</p>
<p class="ppn8">Breathing peace,<br />
Breathing rest</p>
<p class="ppn4">Out of the gardens of Sleep in the West.</p>

<p class="ppn6 p1">O come to me ... wandering</p>
<p class="ppn7">Wind of the West!</p>
<p class="ppn6">Gray Doves of slumber</p>
<p class="ppn7">Come hither to nest....</p>
<p class="ppn6">Ah, sweet now the fragrance</p>
<p class="ppn8">Below the dim trees<br />
Of the White Rose of Rest</p>
<p class="ppn4">That blooms in the gardens of Sleep in the West.</p>

<p class="p1">On leaving Maniace W. S. wrote to Dr. Goodchild:</p>

<p class="pbqr p1">Friday, 7th March, 1902.</p>

<p class="pbq">To-morrow we leave here for Taormina.... And, not
without many regrets, I am glad to leave&mdash;as, in turn, I
shall be glad (tho’ for other reasons) when the time
comes to leave Taormina. My wife says I am never
satisfied, and that Paradise itself would be intolerable
for me if I could not get out of it when I wanted. And
there is some truth in what she says, though it is a partial
truth, only. I think external change as essential to
some natures as passivity is to others: but this may
simply mean that the inward life in one person may best
be hypnotised by ‘a still image,’ that of another may best
be hypnotised by a wavering image or series of wavering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span>
images. It is not change of scene one needs so much
as change in these wavering images. For myself, I
should, now, in many ways be content to spend the most
of my life in some quiet place in the country, with a
garden, a line of poplars and tall elms, and a great sweep
of sky....</p>

<p class="pr6 reduct">Your friend affectionately,</p>
<p class="pr4 reduct"><span class="smcap">William Sharp</span>.</p>

<p class="p1">To Mrs. Philpot.</p>

<p class="pr5 p1 reduct"><span class="smcap">Taormina</span>,</p>
<p class="pr4 reduct">April 3, 1902.</p>

<p class="pn"><span class="smcap">Dear Friend</span>,</p>

<p class="pbq">... It would take pages to describe all the flowers
and other near and far objects which delight one continually.
Persephone has scattered every treasure in this
her birth-island. From my room here in the Castello-a-Mare&mdash;this
long terraced hotel is built on the extreme
edge of a precipitous height outside the Messina Gate
of Taormina&mdash;I look down first on a maze of vividly green
almond trees sloping swiftly down to the deep blue sea,
and over them the snowy vastness of Etna, phantom-white
against the intense blue, with its hitherside 11,000
feet of gulfs of violet morning shadow. About midway
this is broken to the right first by some ancient cactus-covered
fragments of antiquity at the corner of a winding
path, and then by the bend of Santa Caterina garden
wall with fine tall plume-like cypresses filled with a living
green darkness, silhouetted against the foam-white cone.</p>

<p class="pbq">My French windows open on the terrace, it is lovely to
go out early in the morning to watch sunrise (gold to
rose-flame) coming over Calabria, and the purple-blue
emerald straits of Messina and down by the wildly picturesque
shores of these island coasts and across the
Ionian sea, and lying like a bloom on the incredible vastness
of Etna and its rise from distant Syracuse and Mt.
Hybla to its cone far beyond the morning clouds when
clouds there are&mdash;or to go out at sunrise and see a miracle
of beauty being woven anew&mdash;or at night when there
is no moon, but only the flashing of the starry torches,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span>
the serpentine glitter of lights, the soft cry of the aziola,
and the drowsy rhythmic cadence of the sea in the caves
and crags far below. Just now the hum of bees is almost
as loud as the drowsy sighing of the sea: among the
almonds a boy is singing a long drowsy Greek-like chant,
and on the mass of wild rock near the cypresses a goatherd
is playing intermittently on a reed pipe. A few
yards to the right is a long crescent-shaped terrace garden
filled with roses, great shrublike clumps of white and
yellow marguerite, myrtle, lilies, narcissus, sweet-scented
blossom-covered geranium, oranges hanging in yellow
flame, pale-gold lemons. Below the branches a “Purple
Emperor” and a snow-white “May Queen” are hovering
in butterfly wooing. On an oleander above a wilderness
of pink and scarlet geraniums two blue tits are singing
and building, building and singing.</p>

<p class="pbq">Since I wrote the above Easter has intervened. The
strange half pagan, half Christian ceremonies interested
me greatly, and in one of the ceremonials of one processional
part I recognized a striking survival of the
more ancient Greek rites of the Demeter and the Persephonæ-Kôrê
cult.</p>

<p class="p1">To Mrs. Janvier.</p>

<p class="pbqr p1"><span class="smcap">Taormina.</span></p>

<p class="pbq">... It is difficult to do anything here. I should like to
come sometime without anything to do&mdash;without even a
book to read: simply to come and dream, to re-live many
of the scenes of this inexhaustible region of romance: to
see in vision the coming and going of that innumerable
company&mdash;from Ulysses and his wanderers, from Pythagoras
and St. Peter, from that Pancrazio who had
seen Christ in the flesh, from Æschylus, and Dionysius
and Hiero and Gelon, from Pindar and Simonides and
Theocritus, to Richard C&oelig;ur-de-Lion and Garibaldi and
Lord Nelson&mdash;what a strange company!...</p>

<p class="pbq">As for my own work, it is mostly (what there is of it!)
dealing with the literature, etc., of the south. I do not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span>
know whether my long article on Contemporary Italian
Poetry is to be in the April-June issue of <i>The Quarterly</i>,
or the summer issue. I am more interested in a strange
Greek drama I am writing&mdash;<i>The Kôrê of Enna</i>&mdash;than in
anything I have taken up for a long time. My reading
just now is mostly Greek history and Italian literature....
Looking on this deep blue, often violet sea, with the
foam washing below that perhaps laved the opposite
shores of Greece, and hearing the bees on the warm wind,
it is difficult to realise the wet and cold you have apparently
had recently in New York&mdash;or the fogs and cold in
London. I wish you could bask in and sun yourself on
this sea-terrace, and read me the last you have written
of “Captain Dionysius” while <i>I</i> give <i>you</i> tea!</p>

<p class="p1">During our first visit to Sicily, though my husband
realised the beauty of the island, he could not feel its
charm or get in touch with the spirit of the place because
he was overborne by the sense of battle and bloodshed
that he felt pervaded it. When I suggested how much
the fascination of the beautiful island had seized hold
of me he would say: “No, I cannot feel it for the ground
is sodden and every leaf drips with blood.” To his great
relief, on his return there he found, as he said, that he
had got beyond the surface of things, had pierced down
to the great essentials of the ancient land, and had become
one of her devoted lovers.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XXIII</h2>

<p class="pch">LISMORE</p>

<p class="pc"><i>Taormina</i></p>

<p class="p2">Our summer was spent on Arran, Colinsay, and on
“the Green Isle” of Lismore in the sea-mouth of Loch
Linnhe within sight of the blue hills of Morven. We had
rooms in the Ferryman’s cottage at the north point of
the isle, where the tide race was so strong at the ebb in
stormy weather that at times it was impossible to row
across to the Appin shore, even to fetch a telegram whose
advent was signalled to us by a little flag from the post
office&mdash;a quicker way of getting it than by the long road
from the Lismore post office. We spent much of our time
on the water in a little rowing boat. A favourite haunt
was a little Isle of Seals, in the loch, where we one
day found a baby seagull, fat and fully fledged, but a
prisoner by reason of a long piece of grass that had
tightly wound round and atrophied one of its feet. Sometimes
our friend the ferryman would come too. At first
he refused to talk if I was there, because I could not
speak Gaelic, and he thought I was English. But at last
when I had reassured him that I too was a Scot, when he
admitted that though I had not a Highland tongue I had
Highland eyes just like his mother’s&mdash;his shyness wore
away. And one day when we were out on the loch at
sundown, and an exquisite rosy flush lay over hill and
water, he stopped rowing and leant over his oars, silent
for a time, and at last murmured in his slow Highland
English “’Tis&mdash;the&mdash;smile&mdash;of God&mdash;upon&mdash;the&mdash;waters.”</p>

<p>At Lismore F. M. wrote, to quote the author’s own
words, “‘The Four Winds of Eiré’ (long); ‘The Magic
Kingdoms’ (longer and profounder, one of the best<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span>
things F. M. has ever written); ‘Sea-Magic’ (a narrative
and strange Sea-Lore); ‘The Lynn of Dreams’ (a spiritual
study); and ‘Seumas’ (a memory).”</p>

<p>During the summer and autumn he had, as F. M., also
written a long study on the work of W. B. Yeats for <i>The
North American Review</i>; had arranged the first volume
of a selection of tales for the Tauchnitz series, entitled
<i>Wind and Wave</i>; and had prepared a revised and augmented
edition of <i>The Silence of Amor</i> for publication in
America by Mr. Mosher. W. S. meanwhile had not been
idle. After editing a volume of the Poems by our friend,
Eugene Lee-Hamilton, with a long Introduction for <i>The
Canterbury Poets</i>, he was at work on a series of articles
which were intended for a projected book to be called
<i>Literary Geography</i>; and of these there appeared in
<i>Harper’s</i> “Walter Scott’s Land,” “R. L. Stevenson’s
Country”; and a poem, “Capt’n Goldsack.”</p>

<p>Unfortunately, his increasing delicacy not only disabled
him from the continuous heavy strain of work he
was under, but our imperative absence from England
necessitated also the relinquishing of my journalistic
work. The stress of circumstances weighed heavily on
him, as he no longer had the energy and buoyancy with
which to make way against it. At this juncture, however,
one or two friends, who realised the seriousness of
conditions petitioned that he should be put on the Civil
Pension List. The Hon. Alex. Nelson Hood and Mr. Alfred
Austin were the chief movers in the matter, and
were backed by Mr. George Meredith, Mr. Thomas Hardy
and Mr. Watts Dunton. Realising however, that the
writings of William Sharp, considered alone, would not
constitute a sufficient claim, Mr. Hood urged William to
allow him to acquaint the Prime Minister with the authorship
of the Fiona Macleod writings, and of the many
sacrifices their production had entailed. My husband
consented providing that Mr. Balfour were told “confidentially
and verbally.” However, it proved necessary
that “a statement of entire claims to consideration should
be laid upon the table of the House of Commons for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span>
inspection of members.” In writing to acquaint my husband
of this regulation, Mr. Hood added:</p>

<p>“I do not presume to say one word to influence you in
the decision you may come to. In such a matter it is for
you to decide. If you will sacrifice your unwillingness
to appear before the world in all the esteem and admiration
which are your due, then, (I may say this) perhaps
you will obtain freedom&mdash;or some freedom&mdash;from anxiety
and worry that will permit you to continue your work
unhampered and with a quiet mind. But advice I cannot
give. I cannot recommend any one to abandon a high
ideal, and your wish to remain unknown is certainly
that....”</p>

<p class="p1">To this W. S. replied:</p>

<p class="pr5 p1 reduct"><span class="smcap">Edinburgh</span>,</p>
<p class="pr4 reduct">21st Aug., 1902.</p>

<p class="pn"><span class="smcap">My dear Alec</span>,</p>

<div class="pbq">
<p>You will have anticipated my decision. No other was
possible for me. I have not made many sacrifices just to
set them aside when a temptation of need occurs. Indeed,
even writing thus of ‘sacrifices’ seems to me unworthy:
these things are nothing, and have brought me
far more than I lost, if not in outward fortune. It is
right, though, to say that the decision is due to no form
of mental obstinacy or arrogance. Rightly or wrongly, I
am conscious of something to be done&mdash;to be done by one
side of me, by one half of me, by the true inward self as
I believe&mdash;(apart from the overwhelmingly felt mystery
of a dual self, and a reminiscent life, and a woman’s life
and nature within, concurring with and oftenest dominating
the other)&mdash;and rightly or wrongly I believe that this,
and the style so strangely born of this inward life, depend
upon my aloofness and spiritual isolation as F. M.
To betray publicly the private life and constrained ideal
of that inward self, for a reward’s sake, would be a poor
collapse. And if I feel all this, as I felt it from the first
(and the <i>nominal</i> beginning was no literary adventure,
but a deep spiritual impulse and compelling circumstances<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[347]</a></span>
of a nature upon which I must be silent) how
much more must I feel it now, when an added and great
responsibility to others has come to me, through the winning
of so already large and deepening a circle of those
of like ideals or at least like sympathies in our own country,
and in America&mdash;and I allude as much or more to
those who while caring for the outer raiment think of and
need most the spirit within that raiment, which I hope
will grow fairer and simpler and finer still, if such is the
will of the controlling divine wills that, above the maze,
watch us in our troubled wilderness.</p>

<p>That is why I said that I could not adopt the suggestion,
despite promise of the desired pension, even were
that tenfold, or any sum. As to ‘name and fame,’ well,
that is not my business. I am glad and content to be a
‘messenger,’ an interpreter it may be. Probably a wide
repute would be bad for the work I have to do. Friends
I want to gain, to win more and more, and, in reason,
“to do well”: but this is always secondary to the deep
compelling motive. In a word, and quite simply, I believe
that a spirit has breathed to me, or entered me, or
that my soul remembers or has awaked (the phraseology
matters little)&mdash;and, that being so, that my concern is not
to think of myself or my ‘name’ or ‘reward,’ but to do
(with what renunciation, financial and other, may be
necessary) my truest and best.</p>

<p>And then, believing this, I have faith you see in the
inward destiny. I smiled when I put down your long,
affectionate, and good letter. But it was not a smile of
bitterness: it was of serene acceptance and confidence.
And the words that came to my mind were those in the
last chorus of Oedipus at Kolônos,</p>

<p>“Be no more troubled, and no longer lament, for all
these things will be accomplished.”</p>

<p>Then, too, there’s the finitude of all things. Why
should one bother deeply when time is so brief. Even
the gods passed, you know, or changed from form to
form. I used to remember Renan’s ‘Prayer on the
Acropolis’ by heart, and I recall those words “Tout n’est<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[348]</a></span>
ici-bas que symbole et que songe. Les dieux passent
comme les hommes et il ne serait pas bon qu’ils fussent
eternels.” ...</p>

<p>Elizabeth, who is on a visit to Fife, will, I know, whole-heartedly
endorse my decision.</p>

<p>Again all my gratitude and affection, dear Alec,</p></div>

<p class="pr6 reduct">Your friend,</p>
<p class="pr4 reduct"><span class="smcap">Will</span>.</p>

<p class="p1">Early in September Mr. Hood sent the welcome information
to my husband that the Prime Minister had decided
“on the strength of the assurance that Mr. Sharp
is F. M.” to make him a grant that would meet his pressing
needs and enable him to go abroad for the winter.</p>

<p>A few days before this message reached W. S. he had
written to his friend.</p>

<p class="pbqr p1">23d Aug.</p>

<p class="pn"><span class="smcap">Dear Julian</span>,</p>

<div class="pbq">
<p>A little line to greet you on your arrival in Venice,
and to wish you there a time of happy rest and inspiration.
May the spirit of the Sea-Queen whisper to you in
romance and beauty.</p>

<p>How I wish I could look in on you at the Casa Persico!
I love Venice as you do. I hope you will not find great
changes, or too many visitors: and beware of the September
heats, and above all the September mosquito!</p>

<p>“Julian” ought to have a great lift, and not the least
pleasure in looking forward to seeing you again early in
October is that of hearing some more of your book of
Venice and of the other Julian.</p>

<p>[“Julian” is the name of the hero of a book, <i>Adria</i>,
on which Mr. Hood was then at work.]</p>

<p>If all goes well&mdash;and I have been working so hard, and
done so much, that things ought to go smoothly with me
again&mdash;then we hope to leave London for Sicily about the
21st Oct., and to reach Taormina <i>about</i> the 26th of that
month.</p>

<p>I need not say how glad I am that you <i>knew</i> I could
not decide otherwise than I did: and I am more than ever<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[349]</a></span>
glad and proud of a friendship so deeply sympathetic and
intuitively understanding.</p></div>

<p class="pr6 reduct">Ever affectionately yours, dear Friend,</p>
<p class="pr4 reduct">Will.</p>

<p class="pbq">P. S. By the way, you will be glad to know that Baron
Tauchnitz is also going to bring out in 2 vols. a selection
of representative tales by Fiona Macleod. The book
called <i>The Magic Kingdoms</i> has been postponed till next
year, but the first part of it will appear in <i>The Monthly
Review</i> in December probably. Stories, articles, studies,
will appear elsewhere.</p>

<p class="pbq">Your friend W. S. has been and is not less busy, besides
maturing work long in hand. So at least I can’t be accused
of needless indolence.</p>

<p class="p1">To his great relief October-end found us at Taormina
once again; and on Allhallow-e’en he wrote to Mrs.
Janvier:</p>

<p class="pbqr p1">Oct. 30th.</p>

<div class="pbq">
<p>... We reached Messina all right, and Giardini, the
Station for Taormina, in fair time; then the lovely winding
drive up to unique and beautiful and wildly picturesque
Taormina and to the lovely winter villa and
grounds of Santa Caterina where a warm welcome met
us from Miss Mabel Hill, with whom we are to stay till
the New Year.... I have for study a pleasant room
on the garden terrace, at the Moorish end of the old convent-villa
with opposite the always open door windows
or great arch trellised with a lovely ‘Japanesy’ vine,
looking down through a sea of roses and lemon and orange
to the deep blue Ionian Sea. The divine beauty,
glow, warmth, fragrance, and classic loveliness of this
place would delight you.... Overhead there is a wilderness
of deep blue, instinct with radiant heat and an almost
passionate clarity. Forza, Mola, Roccafiorita, and
other little mountain towns gleam in it like sunlit ivory.
Over Forza (or Sforza rather) the storm-cloud of the
Greco, with a rainbow hanging like a scimitar over the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[350]</a></span>
old, pagan, tragic, savagely picturesque mountain-ridge
town. The bells of the hill-chapels rise and fall on the
wind, for it is the beginning of All Souls festa. It is the
day when ‘things’ are abroad and the secret ways are
more easily to be traversed.</p>

<p>Beneath my Moorish arch I look down through clustering
yellow roses and orange and lemon to green-blue
water, and thence across the wild-dove’s breast of the
Ionian Sea. Far to the S. E. and S., over where Corinth
and Athens lie, are great still clouds, salmon-hued on the
horizon with pink domes and summits. An intense stillness
and the phantasmagoria of a forgotten dreamland
dwell upon the long western promontories of the Syracusan
coast, with the cloud-like Hyblæan hill like a violet,
and a light as of melting honey where Leontinoi and Siracusa
lie....</p>

<p>Nov. 8: This is a week later. I have accidentally destroyed
or mislaid a sheet of this letter. Nothing of importance&mdash;only
an account of the nocturnal festa of All
Souls, with the glittering lights and the people watching
by the graves, and leaving lights and flowers on each, the
one to show the wandering souls the way back to the
grave, the other to disguise the odour of mortality and
illude them with the old beauty of the lost world&mdash;and
the offerings of handfuls of beans, to give them sustenance
on this their one mortal hour in the year. We
three came here yesterday (Elizabeth, Miss Hill and I)
and enjoyed the marvellous mountain-climbing journey
from the sea-level of Giarre (near Catania) up to beautiful
Linguaglossa, and Castiglione 2000 ft. high and so
on to Randazzo and Maletto (3000 ft.) where we got out,
and drove thro’ the wild lava-lands of this savage and
brigand haunted region to Castello di Maniace where il
Signor Ducino Alessandro gave us cordial and affectionate
welcome.</p>

<p>Sunday 9th. The weather is doubtful, but if it keeps
fine we are going to drive down the gorges of the Simalthos
(the Simeto of today) and then up by the crags and
wild town of Bronte, and back by the old Ætnean hillroad<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[351]</a></span>
of the ancient Greeks, or by the still more ancient
Sikelian tombs at a high pass curiously enough known
not by its ancient fame but as the Pass of the Gipsies. As
the country is in a somewhat troubled and restive state
just now, especially over Bronte, all pre-arrangements
have been made to ensure safety....</p>

<p>I hope you have received the Tauchnitz volume of
“Wind and Wave.” The text of Selected Tales has been
revised where advisable, sometimes considerably. The
gain is very marked I think, especially in simplicity. I
hope you will like the preface. The long collective-article
in the <i>Contemporary</i> for October “Sea-Magic and Running
Water” I have already written to you about. One
can never tell beforehand, but in all probability the following
F. M. articles will appear in December (if not
January) issues, viz.:</p>

<p class="pi2">In <i>The Monthly Review</i>&mdash;The Magic Kingdoms.<br />
In <i>The Contemporary</i>&mdash;The Lynn of Dreams.<br />
In <i>The Fortnightly</i>&mdash;The Four Winds of Eirinn.</p>

<p>As soon as I can possibly work free out of my terribly
time-eating correspondence, and am further ahead with
my necessary and commissioned pot-boiling articles etc.
I want to put together two F. M. volumes, one a vol. of
Gaelic essays and Spiritual studies to be called <i>For The
Beauty of an Idea</i> and the other a volume of Verse to be
called probably “The Immortal Hour and Poems” or
else “The Enchanted Valleys.” But I have first a great
deal to get off as W. S. and F. M.</p>

<p>What is dear old Tom doing now? Give him my love,
and affectionate hug, bless the old reprobate! I was delighted
to meet an American admirer (and two hanger-on
American admiresses) of his in Florence, who spoke of
his work with much admiration as well as personal delight.
So I warmed to them mightily in consequence, and
had the pleasure of introducing the latest production&mdash;the
delightful “Consolate Giantess.”</p>

<p>What a letter in length this is! too long for even <i>you</i>,
I fear.”</p></div>

<p class="p1">The following letter from Mr. Robert Hichens, another
devoted lover of Sicily, reached William Sharp at
Maniace:</p>

<p class="pr5 p1 reduct"><span class="smcap">Dover</span>,</p>
<p class="pr4 reduct">Nov. 4, 1902.</p>

<p class="pn"><span class="smcap">My dear Will</span>,</p>

<div class="pbq">
<p>... The cold is setting in and today there is a fierce
east wind. I scarcely dare think of what you are enjoying.
I had hoped to join you at the end of this month,
but the fates are unkind. When I do get away I may
first have to go to the Desert as I am meditating some
work there. Then I hope to make my way there to Sicily
but only late in Spring. Will you still be there? There is
magic in its air&mdash;or else beauty acts on the body as powerfully
as on the soul, and purifies the blood as well as
the soul....</p>

<p>Every sentence I write wrings my heart. I ought not
to write about Sicily. <i>Felix</i> was begun in that delightful
room at Maniace&mdash;with Webster, thoughtfully posed
by Alec&mdash;on a side table within easy reach.</p>

<p>Thank you again for your kind inspiring letter. I
value praise from you.</p></div>

<p class="pr6 reduct">Yours cordially,</p>
<p class="pr4 reduct"><span class="smcap">Robert Hichens</span>.</p>

<p class="p1">Miss Hill and I returned to Sta. Caterina and left my
husband at Maniace, whence a few days later he wrote to
me:</p>


<p class="pr5 p1 reduct"><span class="smcap">Castello di Maniace</span>,</p>
<p class="pr4 reduct">15th Nov., 1902.</p>

<div class="pbq">
<p>How you would have enjoyed today!... one of the
most beautiful of its kind I’ve ever had. It was quite
dark when we rose shortly before six, but lovely dawn
by 6.15, and after a gigantic breakfast we all set off all
armed with rifles and revolvers. We drove up to the cutting
to the left, 1/4 of a mile below Otaheite, and there diverged
and went up the wild road of the Zambuco Pass,
and for another five miles of ascent. Then we were met
by the forest guard and Meli with great jennets (huge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[353]</a></span>
hill-mules as big as horses) and rode over the Serraspina
(6,000 feet). To my great pleasure it was decided we
could risk the further ascent of the great central Watershed
of Sicily, the Serra del Rè (8,000 ft.) and I shall
never forget it. All the way from about 4,000 ft. the air
was extraordinarily light and intoxicating&mdash;and the
views of Central Sicily magnificent beyond words. When
we had ridden to about 7,500 feet thro’ wild mountain
gorges, up vast slopes, across great plateaux, and at last
into the beginning of the vast dense primeval beech-forests
(all an indescribable glory of colour) we dismounted
and did the remaining half hour on foot. Then at last we
were on the summit of the great central watershed.
Thence everything to the south flows to the Ionian Sea,
everything to the north to the Tyrrhenian and Mediterranean.</p>

<p>And oh the views and the extraordinary clarity! Even
with the naked eye I saw all the inland mountains and
valleys and lost forgotten towns, Troina on its two hills,
Castrogiovanni and Alcara, etc. etc. And with the powerful
binoculars I could see all the houses, and trace the
streets and ruined temples etc. in Castrogiovanni on its
extraordinary raised altar-like mountain plateau. Then,
below us, lay all the northern shores of Sicily from Capo
Cefalù to Milazzo on its beautiful great bay, and Capo
Milazzo, and the Lipari Islands (so close with the glass I
could see the few houses on their wild precipitous shores),
from ‘Volcano,’ the original home of Vulcan, and Lipari
itself to Stromboli, and white ships sailing. Enna (Castrogiovanni)
immensely imposing and unforgettable.
And, behind us, Etna vaster, sheerer, more majestic,
more terrible, than I had ever dreamed of it.</p>

<p>Then we lunched, amid that extraordinary and vast
panorama&mdash;seeing 2,000 feet below us the “almost inaccessible”
famous Lake of Balzano, with its Demeter
and Persephone associations (itself about 6,000 feet
among the mountains!) All enjoyed it unspeakably, except
poor old Meli, very nervous about brigands&mdash;poor
old chap, a ransom of 800 francs had to be paid to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[354]</a></span>
capitano of the brigand-lot to free his nephew, who is now
ill after his confinement for many days in a hole under
the lava, where he was half suffocated, and would have
soon died from cold and damp and malaria.</p>

<p>On the way down (in the forest, at about 6,000 feet)
Alec suddenly without a word dashed aside, and sprang
through the sloping undergrowth, and the next moment
I saw him holding his revolver at the head of a man
crouching behind a mass of bramble, etc. But the latter
had first managed to hide or throw away his gun, and
swore he hadn’t got one, and meant no harm, and that
the ugly weapon he carried (a light, long axe of a kind)
was to defend himself from the wolves! His companion
had successfully escaped. The man slunk away, to be
arrested later by the Carabinieri.</p></div>

<p class="p1">On his return to Taormina W. S. wrote to the Author
of <i>Adria</i>, who had gone to Venice for “local colour”:</p>

<p class="pr5 p1 reduct"><span class="smcap">Taormina</span>,</p>
<p class="pr4 reduct">19th Nov., 1902.</p>

<p class="pn"><span class="smcap">Caro Fra Giuliano</span>,</p>

<div class="pbq">
<p>To my surprise I hear from our common friend, Mr.
Aurelio Da Rù, the painter of Venice, that you are at
present staying at San-Francisco-in-Deserto. This seems
to me a damp and cold place to choose for November, but
possibly you are not to be there long: indeed, Da Rù hints
at an entanglement with a lady named “Adria.” Perhaps
I am indiscreet in this allusion. If so, pray forgive
me. The coincidence struck me as strange, for only
the other day I heard our friend Alec Hood speaking of
an Adria, of whom, to say the least of it, he seemed to
think very highly. By the way, I wouldn’t tell him
(A. H.) too much of your affairs or doings&mdash;or <i>he may
put them in a book</i>. (He’s a “literary feller” you know!)</p>

<p>I have just been staying with him&mdash;and I wish when
you see him you would tell him what a happy time I had
at Maniace, and how pleasantly I remember all our walks
and talks and times together, and how the true affection
of a deepened friendship is only the more and more enhanced
and confirmed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[355]</a></span></p>

<p>It is a lovely day, and very warm and delightful. Sitting
by the open French-window of my study, with a
bunch of narcissus on my table, there is all the illusion
of Spring. I have just gone into an adjoining Enchanted
Garden I often frequent, and gathered there some sprays
of the Balm of Peace, the azure blossoms of Hope, and
the white roses of Serenity and Happiness and sending
them, by one of the wild-doves of loving thought and sympathy
and affection, to Alec at Maniace.</p>

<p>Ever, dear Fra Giuliano, with love to Da Rù, the Graziani,
the Manins, and above all to Alec,</p></div>

<p class="p1">And again two days later:</p>

<p class="pn1"><span class="smcap">Shar Shan, Bor!</span></p>

<p class="pbq">Which, being interpreted, is Romany (Gypsy) for
“How d’ye do, Mate!”&mdash;I fear you are having a bad
day for your return to Maniace. Here, at any rate, ‘tis
evil weather. Last night the wind rose (after ominous
signals of furtive lightnings in every quarter) to the
extent of tempest: and between two and three a.m. became
a hurricane. This lasted at intervals till dawn, and
indeed since: and at times I thought a cyclone had
seized Taormina and was intent on removing ‘Santa
Caterina’ on to the top of Isola Bella. Naturally, sleep
was broken. And in one long spell, when wind and a
coarse rain (with a noise like sheep that has become
sleet) kept wakefulness in suspense, my thoughts turned
to Venice, to Giuliano in the lonely rain-beat wave-washed
sanctuary of San-Francisco-in-Deserto; to Daniele
Manin, with his dreams of the Venice that was and
his hopes of the Venice to be; and to Adria, stilled at
last in her grave in the lagunes after all her passionate
life and heroic endeavour. And then I thought of the
Venice they, and you, and I, love:&mdash;and recalled lines of
Jacopo Sannazaro which I often repeat to myself when
I think of the Sea-City as an abstraction&mdash;</p>

<p class="ppq6 p1">“O d’Italia dolente<br />
Eterno lumine<br />
Venezia!”</p>

<p class="pbq p1">And that’s all I have to say to-day!... except to add
that this very moment there has come into my mind the
remembrance of some words of Montesquieu I read last
year (in the <i>Lettres Persanes</i>), to the effect (in English)
that “altho’ one had seen all the cities of the world,
there might still be a surprise in store for him in Venice,”&mdash;which
would be a good motto for your book.</p>

<p class="pr4 reduct"><span class="smcap">Will</span>.</p>

<p class="p1">The few entries in William Sharp’s Diary for 1903
begin with New Year’s Day:</p>

<p class="pbqr p1"><span class="smcap">Taormina.</span></p>

<p class="pbq"><i>Thursday, 1st Jan., 1903.</i> Yesterday afternoon I ended
literary work for the year, at p. 62 on my MS. of
“The King’s Ring” with the sentence: “Flora Macdonald
saw clearly that the hearts of these exiles and
New Englanders would follow a shepherd more potent
than any kind, the shepherd called Freedom, who forever
keeps his flocks of hopes and ideals on the hills of
the human heart.” To-day, this afternoon, wrote till end
of p. 70. In the evening we dined with Robert Hichens
at the Hotel Timeo.</p>

<p class="pbq"><i>Sat. 3rd.</i> Finished “The King’s Ring.” Revised: and
sent off to Mary to type. We lunched at the Timeo.
After lunch we spent an hour or more in the Greek
Theatre with Hichens. Then we walked to Miss Valerie
White’s villa and had tea with her. In evening ‘turned
in’ about 9 and read Bourget’s Calabria <i>Ricordi</i>, and
Lenormant on Crotone and Pythagorus.”</p>

<p class="pbqr p1">Saturday, 9th Jan.</p>

<p class="pn"><i>To the Editor of The Pall Mall Magazine</i>:<br /></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,</p>

<p class="pbq">I have written a story somewhat distinct in kind
from the work associated with my name, and think<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[357]</a></span>
it is one that should appeal to a far larger public than
most of my writings do: for it deals in a new way with
a subject of unpassing interest, the personality of Flora
Macdonald. “The King’s Ring,” however, is not concerned
with the hackneyed Prince Charlie episode. It is,
in a word, so far as I know, the only narrative presentment
of the remarkable but almost unknown late-life
experiences of Flora Macdonald: for few know that,
long after her marriage, she went with her husband and
some of her family and settled in South Carolina, just
before the outbreak of the War of Independence: how
her husband was captured and imprisoned: how two of
her sons in the Navy were lost tragically at sea: and how
she herself with one daughter with difficulty evaded interference,
and set sail from a southern port for Scotland
again, and on that voyage was wounded in an encounter
with a French frigate. True, all these things are only
indicated in “The King’s Ring,” for fundamentally the
story is a love-story, that of Flora M.’s beautiful eldest
daughter Anne and Major Macleod, with the tragical
rivalry of Alasdair Stuart, bearer of the King’s Ring.</p>

<p>Practically the facts of the story are authentic: save
the central episode of Alasdair Stuart, which is of my
own invention. I think the story would appeal to many
not only in Scotland and England but in America.</p>

<p class="pr6 reduct">Yours very truly,</p>
<p class="pr4 reduct"><span class="smcap">Fiona Macleod</span>.</p>

<p class="p1">The story was accepted and the first instalment was
printed in the <i>Pall Mall Magazine</i> in May, 1904; but after
its appearance the author did not care sufficiently for
it to republish it in book form.</p>

<p class="p1">The Diary continues:</p>

<div class="pbq">
<p class="p1"><i>Sunday 4th.</i> Began article on “Thro’ Nelson’s Duchy”
commissioned for <i>The Pall Mall Magazine</i>. Received
<i>The Monthly Review</i> for Jany. with the Fiona Macleod
article, “The Magic Kingdoms”: the <i>Mercure de France</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[358]</a></span>
for January: and proofs from the <i>Pall Mall Magazine</i>
of my articles on Scott and George Eliot. Among several
letters one from Mrs. Gilchrist, who says (apropos
of F. M.’s “By Sundown Shores”) “she always can
send one back to the distance which is all the future.”</p>

<p>Later, after a walk alone I looked in at Villa Bella
Rocca and had a pleasant chat with M. et Mme. Grandmont
about Anatole France, Loti, and treatment of sea
in “Pecheur d’Islande,” Bourget’s and Lenormant’s
“Calabria,” etc. Wrote after dinner from 9 till 11; and
read some Bacchylides, etc. At 11.15 suddenly some
five or six cocks began to crow vehemently: and about
five minutes later abruptly stopped.</p>

<p><i>Monday 5th.</i> A day of perfect beauty. Divinely warm.
In morning sat out on Loggia two hours or so working
at revision. After lunch Hichens came for me and we
walked down to Capo San Andrea and thence took a
boat with two men (Francesco and his brother) across
to Capo Schiso (Naxos) and thence walked some five or
six miles back. Tea at H’s. A divinely lovely sunset.</p>

<p><i>Tuesday 6th.</i> As beautiful a day as yesterday. More
could be said of no day. Worked at “Thro’ Nelson’s
Duchy” material, and wrote a letter. A walk after
lunch. Then again a little work. Had a charming letter
from Joachim Gasquet, and to F. M. one from Stephen
Gwynn (with his “Today and Tomorrow in Ireland”)&mdash;and
an <i>Academy</i> with pleasant para. about F. M. saying
just what I would want said (with an allusion to a
special study of F. M. in the <i>Harvard Monthly</i>, by the
Editor).</p>

<p>This afternoon, the Festa of the Epiphany, more great
doings with the delayed Xmas tree treat of the School-children
of Taormina. Much enjoyed it.</p>

<p><i>Thursday 8th.</i> Finished the P. M. Mag. commissioned
article “Thro’ Nelson’s Duchy”&mdash;about 5,000 words&mdash;then
revised: marked with directions the 8 fine Photos
selected by A. N. H. (Alex. Nelson Hood) and sent off to
be registered....</p>

<p>After dinner wrote one or two letters including longish
one of literary advice to Karl Walter. Read some Æschylus’
“Eumenides.”</p></div>

<p>This is the letter in question:</p>

<p class="pr5 p1 reduct"><span class="smcap">Taormina</span>,</p>
<p class="pr4 reduct">Jan., 1903.</p>

<p class="pn"><span class="smcap">My dear Walter</span>,</p>

<p class="pbq">... In some respects your rendering of your sonnet is
towards improvement. But it has one immediate and
therefore fatal flaw. Since the days of Sophocles it has
been recognized as a cardinal and imperative law, that a
great emotion (or incident, or idea, or collective act)
must not be linked to an effective image, an incongruous
metaphor. Perhaps the first and last word about passion
(in a certain sense only, of course, for to immortal
things there is no mortal narrowing or limiting in expression)
has been said more than two thousand years
ago by Sappho and to-day by George Meredith. “The
apple on the topmost bough” ... all that lovely fragment
of delicate imperishable beauty remains unique.
And I know nothing nobler than Meredith’s “Passion is
noble strength on fire.” ... But turn to a poet you
probably know well, and study the imagery in some of the
Passion-sonnets in “The House of Life” of Rossetti&mdash;of
Passion</p>

<p class="ppn10 p1">... “creature of poignant thirst</p>
<p class="ppn6">And exquisite hunger” ...</p>

<p class="pbqn p1">&mdash;the splendid sexual diapason in the sestet of the sonnet
celled “The Kiss”&mdash;or, again, to “the flame-winged
harp-player.”</p>

<p class="ppn10 p1">... “thou art Passion of Love,</p>
<p class="ppn6">The mastering music walks the sunlit sea.”</p>

<p class="pbqn p1">Perhaps I have said enough to illustrate my indication
as to the opening metaphor in your sonnet. Apart from
the incongruity of the image, it has no logical congruity
with the collateral idea of Fear. The sonnet itself turns
on a fine emotion in your mind: let that emotion shape
a worthy raiment of metaphor and haunting cadence of
music, <i>not</i> as the metricist desires but as the poet au
fond compels.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[360]</a></span>
Yes, both in sonnet-writing and in your terza-rima narrative
(cultivate elision here, also fluent terminals, or you
will find the English prosody jib at the foreign reins)
you will find G. useful. But the secret law of rhythm in
a moving or falling wave, in the cadence of wind, in the
suspiration of a distant song, in running water, in the
murmur of leaves, in chord confluent upon chord, will
teach you more&mdash;if you will listen long enough and know
what you listen to.</p>

<p class="pbq">I hope I have not discouraged you. I mean the reverse
of that.</p>

<p class="pr6 reduct">Your friend,</p>
<p class="pr4 reduct"><span class="smcap">William Sharp</span>.</p>

<p class="p1">I add here a letter of criticism and encouragement
sent by F. M. to another young writer, in the previous
summer, to the nephew of William Black the novelist:</p>


<p class="pbqr p1"><span class="smcap">London</span>, June, 1902.</p>

<p class="pn"><span class="smcap">My dear Mr. Black</span>,</p>

<div class="pbq">
<p>As soon as possible after my return from Brittany I
read your MS. It is full of the true sentiment, and has
often charm in the expression: but I think you would do
well to aim at a style simpler still, freer from mannerisms,
and above all from mannerisms identified with the
work of other writers. As I am speaking critically, let
me say frankly that I have found your beautiful tale
too reminiscent ever and again of an accent, a note, a
vernacular (too reminiscent even in names), common to
much that I have written. You are sympathetic enough
to care for much of my work, and loyal enough to say
so with generous appreciation: but just because of this
you should be on guard against anything in my style
savouring of affectation or mannerism. You may be sure
that whatever hold my writings may have taken on the
imagination of what is at most a small clan has been
in despite of and not because of mannerisms, which sometimes
make for atmosphere and versimilitude and sometimes
are merely obvious, and therefore make for weakness
and even disillusion. Be on guard, therefore,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[361]</a></span>
against a sympathy which would lead you to express
yourself in any other way than you yourself feel and
in other terms than the terms of our own mind. Mannerism
is often the colour and contour of a writer’s
mind: but the raiment never fits even the original wearer,
and is disastrous for the borrower, when the mental
habit of mannerism is translated into the mental incertitude
of mannerisms. You have so natural a faculty
and so eager a desire, that I have no hesitation in urging
you to devote your best thought and time and effort to
a worthy achievement.</p>

<p>But no work of the imagination has any value if it
be not shaped and coloured from within. Every imaginative
writer must take his offspring to the Fountain of
Youth, and the only way is through the shadowy and
silent avenues of one’s own heart. My advice to you,
then, is, not to refrain from steeping your thought and
imagination in what is near to your heart and dream,
but to see that your vision is always your <i>own</i> vision, that
your utterance is always your own utterance, and to be
content with no beauty and no charm that are dependent
on another’s vision of beauty and another’s secret of
charm.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, I can advise you no more surely than to
say, write as simply, almost as baldly, above all as <i>naturally</i>
as possible. Sincerity, which is the last triumph
of art, is also its foster-mother. You will do well, I feel
sure: and among your readers you will have none more
interested than</p></div>

<p class="pr6 reduct">Yours Sincerely,</p>
<p class="pr4 reduct"><span class="smcap">Fiona Macleod</span>.</p>

<p class="p1">To another friend he wrote in answer to a question
on ‘style’:</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“Rhythmic balance, fluidity, natural motion, spontaneity,
controlled impetus, proportion, height and depth,
shape and contour, colour and atmosphere, all these go
to every <i>living</i> sentence&mdash;but there, why should I weary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[362]</a></span>
you with uncertain words when you can have a certainty
of instance almost any time where you are: you have
hut to look at a wave to find your exemplar for the ideal
sentence. All I have spoken of is there&mdash;and it is alive&mdash;and
part of one flawless whole.”</p>

<p class="p1">From W. S. to Mrs. Janvier.</p>

<p class="pr5 p1 reduct"><span class="smcap">Taormina</span>,</p>
<p class="pr4 reduct">18th Feb., 1903.</p>

<p class="pbq">... In fact, letters are now my worst evil to contend
against&mdash;for, with this foreign life in a place like this,
with so many people I know, it is almost impossible to get
anything like adequate time for essential work&mdash;and still
less for the imaginative leisure I need, and dreaming out
my work&mdash;to say nothing of reading, etc. As you know,
too, I have continually to put into each day the life of
two persons&mdash;each with his or her own interests, preoccupations,
work, thoughts, and correspondence. I have
really, in a word, quite apart from my own temperament,
to live at exactly double the rate in each day of the
most active and preoccupied persons. No wonder, then,
that I find the continuous correspondence of ‘two persons’
not only a growing weariness, but a terrible strain
and indeed perilous handicap on time and energy for
work....</p>

<p class="p1">A little later William Sharp started for a fortnight’s
trip to Greece by way of Calabria&mdash;Reggio, Crotona,
Taranto, Brindisi to Corfù and Athens, with a view of
gathering impressions for the working out of his projected
book (by W. S.) to be called <i>Greek Backgrounds</i>.</p>

<p><i>En route</i> he wrote to me:</p>

<p class="pbqr p1">23d Jan., 1903.</p>

<div class="pbq">
<p>“Where of all unlikely places do you think this is written
from? Neither Corfù nor Samothrace nor Ithaka
nor Zante, nor any Greek isle betwixt this and the Peloponnesus,
but in Turkey!... i.e., in Turkish Albania,
surrounded by turbaned Turks, fezzed Albanians, and
picturesque kilted Epeirotes, amid some of the loveliest
scenery in the world.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[363]</a></span></p>

<p>You will have had my several cards en route and last
from Târantô. The first of a series of four extraordinary
pieces of almost uncanny good fortune befell me <i>en
route</i>,&mdash;but it would take too long now to write in detail.
Meanwhile I may say I met the first of three people to
whom I already owe much&mdash;and who helped me thro’
every bother at Brindisi. (He is a foreign Consul in
Greece.)</p>

<p>(By the way, the engine from Târantô to Brindisi was
called the <i>Agamemnon</i> and the steamer to Greece the
<i>Poseidon</i>&mdash;significant names, eh?)</p>

<p>I had a delightful night’s rest in my comfortable cabin,
and woke at dawn to find the <i>Poseidon</i> close to the Albanian
shore, and under the superb snow-crowned Acrokerannian
Mountains. The scenery superb&mdash;with Samothrace,
and the Isle of Ulysses, etc., etc., seaward, and
the beautiful mountainous shores of Corfù (here called
<i>Kepkuga</i>, Kêrkyra) on the S.W. and S. There was a
special Consul-Deputation on board, to land two, and
also to take off a number of Turks, Albanians, and Epeirotes
for Constantinople. We put in after breakfast at
Eavri Kagavri&mdash;a Greco-Albanian township of Turkey.
The scattered oriental ‘town’ of the Forty Saints crowns
a long ridge at a considerable height&mdash;the harbour-town
is a cluster of Turkish houses beside an extraordinary
absolutely deserted set of gaunt ruins. Hundreds of
Albanians and Epeirotes, Moslem priests and two Greek
<i>papas</i> (or popes) were on the shore-roads, with several
caravans each of from 20 to 50 mules and horses. Costumes
extraordinarily picturesque, especially the white-kilted
or skirted Albanian mountaineers, and the Larissa
Turks. We were 3 hours&mdash;and I the only ‘privileged’
person to get thro’ with the consul. We took many
aboard&mdash;a wonderful crew, from a wonderful place, the
fairyland of my Greek resident from Paris&mdash;who is on
his way to spend a month with his mother in Athens,
and has asked me to visit him at his house there....</p>

<p>Well, the <i>Poseidon</i> swung slowly out of the bay,&mdash;a
lovely, exciting, strange, unforgettable morning&mdash;and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[364]</a></span>
down the lovely Albanian coast&mdash;now less wild, and
wooded and craggy, something like the West Highlands
at Loch Fyne, etc., but higher and wilder. When off a
place on the Turkish Albanian coast called Pothlakov
(Rothroukon) the shaft of the screw suddenly broke!
The engineer told the captain it would be five hours at
least before it could be mended&mdash;adding, a little later,
that the harm could probably not be rectified here,
and that we should have to ride at sea till a relief
boat came from Corfù or Greece to take off the passengers,
etc.</p>

<p>As no one has a Turkish passport, no one can get
ashore except lucky me, with my influential friend, in a
Turkish steam-pinnacle! (It is so beautiful, so warm,
and so comfortable on the <i>Poseidon</i>, that, in a sense, I’m
indifferent&mdash;and would rather <i>not</i> be relieved in a hurry.)</p>

<p>(Later.) Late afternoon on board&mdash;still no sign of
getting off. No Corfù to-day, now, though about only
an hour’s sail from here! <i>Perhaps</i> tonight&mdash;or a relief
steamer may come. I’ll leave this now, as I want to see
all I can in the sundown light. It is all marvellously
strange and lovely. <i>What</i> a heavenly break-down! <i>What</i>
luck!</p>

<p>Just had a talk with another passenger stamping with
impatience. I didn’t soothe him by remarking I hoped
we should adrift ashore and be taken prisoners by the
Turks. He says he wants to get on. Absurd. “There’s
more beauty here than one can take-in for days to come,”
I said&mdash;“Damn it, sir, what have <i>I</i> got to do with
beauty,”&mdash;he asked indignantly. “Not much, certainly,”
I answered drily, looking him over. An Italian <i>maestro</i>
is on board on his way to Athens&mdash;now playing delightfully
in the salon. A Greek guitarist is going to play
and sing at moonrise. No hills in the world more beautiful
in shape and hue and endless contours&mdash;with gorgeous
colours. Albania is lost Eden, I think. Just
heard that a steamer is to come for us in a few hours,
or less, from Corfù, and tow us into Kêrkyra (the town)&mdash;and
that another Austro-Lloyd from Trieste or Brindisi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[365]</a></span>
will take us on to-morrow sometime from Corfù to
Athens.... The only perfectly happy person on board.</p></div>

<p class="pr4 reduct"><span class="smcap">Will</span>.</p>

<p class="pbqr p1"><span class="smcap">Athens</span>, 29th Jan.</p>

<p class="pbq">... This lovely place is wonderful. How I wish you
were here to enjoy it too. I take you with me mentally
wherever I go. It is a marvellous <i>home-coming</i> feeling
I have here. And I know a strange stirring, a kind of
spiritual rebirth.</p>

<p class="pbqr p1"><span class="smcap">Athens</span>, Feb. 1st.</p>

<p class="pbq">... Yesterday, a wonderful day at Eleusis. Towards
sundown drove through the lovely hill-valley of Daphne,
with its beautifully situated isolated ruin of the Temple
of Aphrodîtê, a little to the north of the Sacred Way
of the Dionysiac and other Processions from Aonai
(Athenai) to the Great Fane of Eleusis. I have never
anywhere seen such a marvellous splendour of living
light as the sundown light, especially at the Temple of
Aphrodîtê and later as we approached Athens and saw
it lying between Lycabettos and the Acropolis, with Hymettos
to the left and the sea to the far right and snowy
Pentelicos behind. The most radiant wonder of light I
have ever seen.</p>

<p class="p1">On his return to Taormina he received the following
letter from Mr. Hichens:</p>

<p class="pr5 p1 reduct"><span class="smcap">St. Stephens,</span></p>
<p class="pr4 reduct"><span class="smcap">Canterbury.</span></p>

<p class="pn"><span class="smcap">My dear Sharp</span>,</p>

<p class="pbq">... Lately I recommended a very clever man, half
Spanish and half German, to read the work of Fiona
Macleod. I wondered how it would strike one who had
never been in our Northern regions, and he has just written
to me, and says: “I am reading with intense delight
Fiona Macleod’s books and thank you very much for
telling me to get them. I ordered them all from London
and cannot tell you how I admire the thoughts, the style,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[366]</a></span>
“toute la couleur locale.” They are books I shall keep
by me and take about with me wherever I go.” I suppose
he feels they are fine, as I feel Tourgeney’s studies
of Russian character are fine, although I have never
lived among Russians. I shall take <i>Anna Karénina</i>
to Italy with me and read it once more. At Marseilles
I saw the “Resurrection” acted. It was very interesting
and touching, though not really a very good play.
It was too episodical. In London it is an immense success.</p>

<p class="pbq">Well, I hope you will really come to winter in Africa.
You can stay at either the Oasis or the Royal and I
think we should be very happy. We must often go out
on donkey-back into the dunes and spend our day there
far out in the desert. I know no physical pleasure,&mdash;apart
from all the accompanying mental pleasure,&mdash;to
be compared with that which comes from the sun and
air of the Sahara and the enormous spaces. This year
I was more enchanted than ever before. Even exquisite
Taormina is hum-drum in comparison. I expect to go
to Italy very early in May, and back to Africa quite at
the beginning of November. Do try to come then as
November is a magnificent month. Don’t reply. You
are too busy. I often miss the walks, and your company,
which wakes up my mind and puts the bellows to my
spark of imagination.</p>

<p class="pr6 reduct">Ever yours,</p>
<p class="pr4 reduct"><span class="smcap">Robert Hichens</span>.</p>

<p class="pbq">I can’t help being rather sorry that you won’t go to
Sicily again for a long while. I always feel as if we
all had a sort of home there.</p>

<p class="pbq">For, as Mr. Hichens wrote to me, “I still think Taormina
the most exquisite place in Europe. On a fine
morning it is ineffably lovely.”</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XXIV</h2>

<p class="pch">WINTER IN ATHENS</p>

<p class="pc"><i>Greek Backgrounds</i></p>

<p class="p2">During the following summer William Sharp saw
George Meredith for the last time. Concerning that visit
to Box Hill he wrote to a friend:</p>

<p class="pbqr p1">Monday, June 22, 1903.</p>

<div class="pbq">
<p>... I am so glad I went down to see George Meredith
to-day. It was goodbye, I fear, though the end may
not be for some time yet: not immediate, for he has
recovered from his recent severe illness and painful accident,
though still very weak, but able to be up, and to
move about a little.</p>

<p>At first I was told he could see no one, but when he
heard who the caller was I was bidden enter, he gave me
a sweet cordial welcome, but was frail and weak and
fallen into the blind alleys that so often await the most
strenuous and vivid lives. But, in himself, in his mind,
there is no change. I felt it was goodbye, and when I
went, I think he felt it so also. When he goes it will be
the passing of the last of the great Victorians. I could
have (selfishly) wished that he had known a certain
secret: but it is better not, and now is in every way as
undesirable as indeed impossible. If there is in truth, as
I believe, and as he believes, a life for us after this, he
will know that his long-loving and admiring younger
comrade has also striven towards the hard way that few
can reach. What I <i>did</i> tell him before has absolutely
passed from his mind: had, indeed, never taken root, and
perhaps I had nurtured rather than denied what <i>had</i>
taken root. If in some ways a little sad, I am glad otherwise.
And I had one great reward, for at the end he
spoke in a way he might not otherwise have done, and in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[368]</a></span>
words I shall never forget. I had risen, and was about
to lean forward and take his hands in farewell, to prevent
his half-rising, when suddenly he exclaimed “Tell
me something of <i>her</i>&mdash;of Fiona. I call her so always, and
think of her so, to myself. Is she well? Is she at work?
Is she true to her work and her ideal? No, <i>that</i> I know!”</p>

<p>It was then he said the following words, which two
minutes later, in the garden, I jotted down in pencil at
once lest I should forget even a single word, or a single
change in the sequence of words. “She is a woman of
genius. That is rare ... so rare anywhere, anytime, in
women or, in men. Some few women ‘have genius,’ but
she is more than that. Yes, she is a woman of genius:
the genius too, that is rarest, that drives deep thoughts
before it. Tell her I think often of her, and of the deep
thought in all she has written of late. Tell her I hope
great things of her yet. And now ... we’ll go, since it
must be so. Goodbye, my dear fellow, and God bless
you.”</p>

<p>Outside, the great green slope of Box Hill rose against
a cloudless sky, filled with a flowing south wind. The
swifts and swallows were flying high. In the beech courts
thrush and blackbird called continually, along the hedgerows
the wild-roses hung. But an infinite sadness was
in it all. A prince among men had fallen into the lonely
and dark way.</p></div>

<p class="p1">Goodbye it was in truth; but it was the older poet who
recovered hold on life and outlived the younger by four
years.</p>

<p>A wet spring, and a still damper autumn affected my
husband seriously; and while we were visiting Mrs.
Glassford Bell in Perthshire he became so ill that we
went to Llandrindod Wells for him to be under special
treatment. As he explained to Mr. Ernest Rhys:</p>

<p class="pr5 p1 reduct"><span class="smcap">Llandrindod Wells</span>,</p>
<p class="pr4 reduct">Sept., 1903.</p>

<p class="pn"><span class="smcap">My dear Ernest</span>,</p>

<p class="pbq">... I know that you will be sorry to learn that things
have not gone well with me. All this summer I have
been feeling vaguely unwell and, latterly, losing strength
steadily.... However, the rigorous treatment, the potent
Saline and Sulphur waters and baths, the not less
potent and marvellously pure and regenerative Llandrindod
air&mdash;and my own exceptional vitality and recuperative
powers&mdash;have combined to work a wonderful
change for the better; which may prove to be more than
“a splendid rally,” tho’ I know I must not be too sanguine.
Fortunately, the eventuality does not much trouble
me, either way: I have lived, and am content, and
it is only for what I don’t want to leave undone that
the sound of ‘Farewell’ has anything deeply perturbing.</p>

<p class="pbqr">W. S.</p>

<p class="p1">And later to Mrs. Janvier:</p>

<p class="pbqr p1"><span class="smcap">London</span>, Sept. 30, 1903.</p>

<p class="pbq">Thanks for your loving note. But you are not to worry
yourself about me. I’m all right, and as cheerful as a
lark&mdash;let us say as a lark with a rheumatic wheeze in its
little song-box, or gout in its little off-claw.... Anyway,
I’ll laugh and be glad and take life as I find it, till the
end. The best prayer for me is that I may live vividly
till “Finis,” and work up to the last hour....</p>

<p class="pbq">My love to you both, and know me ever your irrepressible,</p>

<p class="pbqr"><span class="smcap">Billy</span>.</p>

<p class="p1">In a letter to Mr. Alden (Aug. 25th, 1903) he describes
the work he had on hand at the moment, and the book he
had projected and hoped to write:</p>

<div class="pbq">
<p class="p1">“ ... in the <i>Pall Mall Magazine</i> you may have noticed
a series of topographical papers (with as much or more
of anecdotal and reminiscent and critical) contributed,
under the title of “Literary Geography,” by myself.
The first three were commissioned by the editor to see
how they ‘took.’ They were so widely liked, and those
that followed, that this summer he commissioned me to
write a fresh series, one each month till next March. Of
these none has been more appreciated than the double
article on the Literary Geography of the Lake of Geneva.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[370]</a></span>
Forthcoming issues are The English Lake Country, Meredith,
Thackery, The Thames, etc. In the current issue I
deal with Stevenson.</p>

<p>... About my projected Greek book, to comprise
Magna Grecia as well, i. e. Hellenic Calabria and Sicily,
etc.... I want to make a book out of the material gathered,
old and new, and to go freshly all over the ground....
I intend to call it <i>Greek Backgrounds</i> and to deal
with the ancient (recreated) and modern backgrounds of
some of the greatest of the Greeks&mdash;as they were and are&mdash;as,
for example, of Æschylus, Sophocles, Euripides,
Empedocles, Theocritus, etc.&mdash;and of famous ancient
cities, Sybaris, Corinth, etc.; and deal with the home or
chief habitat or famous association. For instance:</p></div>

<p class="p1">The two following letters were acknowledgments of
birthday greetings. In the first to Mr. Stedman our plans
for that winter are described:</p>

<p class="pr5 p1 reduct"><span class="smcap">The Grosvenor Club</span>,</p>
<p class="pr4 reduct">Oct. 2, 1903.</p>

<p class="pn"><span class="smcap">My dear E. C. S.</span>,</p>

<div class="pbq">
<p>Two days ago, on Wednesday’s mail, I posted a letter
to reach you, I hope, on the morning of your birthday&mdash;and
today, to my very real joy, I safely received your
long and delightful letter. It has been a true medicine&mdash;for,
as I told you, I’ve been gravely ill. And it came
just at the right moment, and warmed my heart with
its true affection.</p>

<p>... I know you’ll be truly glad to hear that the tidings
about myself can be more and more modified by good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[371]</a></span>
news from my physician,&mdash;a man in whom I have the utmost
confidence and who knows every weakness as well
as every resource and reserve of strength in me, and
understands my temperament and nature as few doctors
do understand complex personalities.</p>

<p>He said to me today “You look as if you were well
contented with the world.” I answered “Yes, of course I
am. In the first place I’m every day feeling stronger,
and in the next, and for this particular day, I’ve just had
a letter of eight written pages from a friend whom I have
ever dearly loved and whom I admire not less than I
love.” He knew you as a poet as well as the subtlest and
finest interpreter of modern poetry&mdash;and indeed (tho’ I
had forgotten) I had given him a favourite volume and
also lent your Baltimore addresses.</p>

<p>When I’m once more in the land of Theocritus (and
oh how entrancing it is) I’ll be quite strong and well
again, he says. Indeed I’m already ‘a live miracle’!
We sail by the Orient liner “Orizaba” on the 23rd; reach
Naples (via Gibraltar and Marseilles) 9 to 10 days later;
and leave by the local mail-boat same evening for Messina&mdash;arrive
there about 8 on Monday morning&mdash;catch
the Syracuse mail about 10, change at 12 at Giarre, and
ascend Mt. Etna by the little circular line to Maletto
about 3,000 ft. high, and thence drive to the wonderful old
Castle of Maniace to stay with our dear friend there, the
Duke of Bronte&mdash;our third or fourth visit now. We’ll be
there about a fortnight: then a week with friends at
lovely and unique Taormina: and then sail once more,
either from Messina or Naples direct to the Piræus, for
Athens, where we hope to spend the winter and spring.</p>

<p>How I wish you were to companion us. In Sicily, I
often thought of you, far off Brother of Theocritus. You
would so delight in it all, the Present that mirrors the
magical Past; the Past that penetrates like stars the purple
veils of the Present.</p>

<p>Yes, I know well how sincere is all you say as to the
loving friend awaiting me&mdash;awaiting <i>us</i>&mdash;if ever we cross
the Atlantic: but it is gladsome to hear it all the same.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[372]</a></span>
All affectionate greetings to dear Mrs. Stedman, a true
and dear friend.</p></div>

<p class="pr10 reduct">Ever, dear Stedman,</p>
<p class="pr8 reduct">Your loving friend,</p>
<p class="pr4 reduct"><span class="smcap">William Sharp</span>.</p>

<p class="pbqr p1">13th Sept., 1903.</p>

<p class="pn"><span class="smcap">Dear Mrs. Gilchrist</span>,</p>

<p class="pbq">It is at all times a great pleasure to hear from you,
and that pleasure is enhanced by hearing from you on
my birthday and by your kind remembrance of the occasion....</p>

<p class="pbq">We look forward to Athens greatly, though it is not
(as in Elizabeth’s case) my first visit to that land of entrancing
associations and still ever-present beauty. But
as one grows older, one the more recognises that ‘climate’
and ‘country’ belong to the geography of the soul
rather than to that secondary physical geography of
which we hear so much. The winds of heaven, the dreary
blast of the wilderness, the airs of hope and peace, the
tragic storms and cold inclemencies&mdash;these are not the
property of our North or South or East, but are of the
climes self-made or inherited or in some strange way
become our ‘atmosphere.’ And the country we dream of,
that we long for, is not yet reached by Cook nor even
chartered by Baedeker. You and yours are often in our
thought. In true friendship, distance means no more
than that the sweet low music is far off: but it is there.</p>

<p class="pr8 reduct">Your friend,</p>
<p class="pr4 reduct"><span class="smcap">William Sharp</span>.</p>

<p class="p1">We journeyed by sea to Naples. Our hopes of a chat
with our friends the Janviers at Marseilles were frustrated
by a violent gale we encountered. As my husband
wrote to Mrs. Janvier while at sea:</p>

<p class="pr5 p1 reduct"><span class="smcap">R.M.S. Orizaba,</span></p>
<p class="pr4 reduct">Oct. 31, 1903.</p>

<div class="pbq">
<p>It seems strange to write to you on the Festival of Samhain&mdash;the
Celtic Summer-end, our Scottish Hallowe’en&mdash;here<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[373]</a></span>
on these stormy waters between Sardinia and Italy.
It is so strong a gale, and the air is so inclement and
damp that it is a little difficult to realise we are approaching
the shores of Italy. But wild as the night is I want
to send you a line on it, on this end of the old year, this
night of powers and thoughts and spiritual dominion.</p>

<p>It was a disappointment not to get ashore at Marseilles&mdash;but
the fierce gale (a wild mistral) made it impossible.
Indeed the steamer couldn’t approach: we lay-to for 3
or 4 hours behind a great headland some 4 or 5 miles to
S. W. of the city, and passengers and mails had to be
driven along the shore and embarked from a small quarry
pier.... We had a very stormy and disagreeable passage
all the way from Plymouth and through the Bay.
... The first part of the voyage I was very unwell,
partly from an annoying heart attack. You may be sure
I am better again, or I could not have withstood the
wild gale which met us far south in the Gulf of Lyons
and became almost a hurricane near Marseilles. But
I gloried in the superb magnificence of the lashed and
tossed sport of the mistral, as we went before it like
an arrow before a gigantic bow.</p>

<p>It is now near sunset and I am writing under the shelter
of a windsail on the upper deck, blowing ‘great guns’
though I don’t think we are in for more than a passing
gale. But for every reason I shall be glad to get ashore,
not that I want to be in Naples, which I like least of any
place in Italy, but to get on to Maniace ... where I so
much love to be, and where I can work and dream so
well....</p></div>

<p class="p1">But the gale increased and became one of the wildest
we had ever known, as William reminded me later when
he showed me an unrhymed poem he had composed&mdash;exactly
as it stands&mdash;in the middle of the night, and the
next day, in Naples, recalled it and wrote it down. It
was his way of mental escape from a physical condition
which induced great nervous strain or fatigue, to create
imaginatively a contrary condition and environment, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[374]</a></span>
so to identify himself with it, that he could become oblivious
to surrounding actualities. This is the poem:</p>

<p class="pch">INVOCATION</p>

<p class="pph6">Play me a lulling tune, O Flute-Player of Sleep,</p>
<p class="pph6">Across the twilight bloom of thy purple havens,</p>
<p class="pph6">Far off a phantom stag on the moonyellow highlands</p>
<p class="pph6">Ceases; and as a shadow, wavers; and passes:</p>
<p class="pph6">So let Silence seal me and Darkness gather, Piper of Sleep.</p>

<p class="pph6 p1">Play me a lulling chant, O Anthem-maker,</p>
<p class="pph6">Out of the fall of lonely seas, and the wind’s sorrow:</p>
<p class="pph6">Behind are the burning glens of the sunset-sky</p>
<p class="pph6">Where like blown ghosts the sea-mews wail their desolate sea-dirges:</p>
<p class="pph6">Make me of these a lulling chant, O Anthem-maker.</p>

<p class="pph6 p1">No&mdash;no&mdash;from nets of silence weave me, O Sigher of Sleep,</p>
<p class="pph6">A dusky veil ash-gray as the moonpale moth’s grey wing;</p>
<p class="pph6">Of thicket-stillness woven, and sleep of grass, and thin evanishing air</p>
<p class="pph6">Where the tall reed spires breathless&mdash;for I am tired, O Sigher of Sleep,</p>
<p class="pph6">And long for thy muffled song as of bells on the wind, and the wind’s cry</p>
<p class="pph6">Falling, and the dim wastes that lie</p>
<p class="pph6">Beyond the last, low, dim, oblivious sigh.</p>

<p class="p1">During a short visit to Maniace W. S. wrote to Mrs.
Philpot:</p>

<p class="pbqr p1">11th Nov., 1903.</p>

<p class="pbq">... At this season of the year, beautiful and unique
in its appeal and singular wild fascination as it is, this
place does not suit me climatically, being for one thing
too high between 2,000 and 3,000 ft. and also too much
under the domination of Etna, who swings vast electric
current, and tosses thunder charged cloud-masses to and
fro like a Titan acolyte swinging mighty censers at the
feet of the Sun. We drive to Taormina on Tuesday and
the divine beauty and not less divinely balmy and regenerative
climate&mdash;sitting as she does like the beautiful
goddess Falcone worshipped there of old, perched on her
orange and olive-clad plateau, hundreds of feet above
the peacock-hued Ionian Sea, with one hand as it were
reaching back to Italy (Calabria ever like opal or amethyst
to the North-east), with the other embracing all the
lands of Etna to Syracuse and the Hyblæan Mount, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[375]</a></span>
lands of Empedocles and Theocritus, of Æschylus and
Pindar, of Stesichorus and Simonides, and so many other
great names&mdash;and with her face ever turned across the
Ionian Sea to that ancient Motherland of Hellas, where
once your soul and mine surely sojourned.</p>

<p class="pbq">We shall have a delightful “going” and one you would
enjoy to the full.... Tomorrow if fine and radiant we
start for that absolutely unsurpassable expedition to the
great orange gardens a thousand feet lower at the S. W.
end of the Duchy. We first drive some eight miles or so
through wild mountain land till we come to the gorges
of the Simeto and there we mount our horses and mules
and with ample escort before and behind ride in single
file for about an hour and a half. Suddenly we come
upon one of the greatest orange groves in Europe&mdash;26,000
trees in full fruit, an estimated crop of 3,000,000! stretching
between the rushing Simeto and great cliffs. Then
once more to the saddle and back a different way to barbaric
Bronte and thence a ten mile drive back along the
ancient Greek highway from Naxos to sacred Enna. And
so, for the moment, à revedèrla!”</p>

<p class="p1">After a delightful week at Corfù we settled in Athens
(at Maison Merlin) for four months, and found pleasant
companionship with members of the English and American
Schools of Archeology&mdash;of which Mr. Carl Bosenquet
and Prof. Henry Fowler were respectively the heads&mdash;with
Dr. Wilhelm head of the Austrian School,&mdash;with
Mr. Bikelas the Greek poet, at whose house we met several
of the rising Greek men of letters, and other residents
and wanderers.</p>

<p>The winter was very cold and at first my husband was
very ill&mdash;the double strain of his life seemed to consume
him like a flame. At the New Year he wrote again to
Mrs. Philpot:</p>

<p class="pr5 p1 reduct"><span class="smcap">Maison Merlin,</span></p>
<p class="pr4 reduct"><span class="smcap">Athens.</span></p>

<p class="pn"><span class="smcap">Dear Friend</span>,</p>

<p class="pbq">This is mainly to tell you that I’ve come out of my severe
feverish attack with erect (if draggled) colours and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[376]</a></span>
hope to march “cock-a-hoopishly” into 1904 and even
further if the smiling enigmatical gods permit!... To-day
I heard a sound as of Pan piping, among the glens on
Hymettos, whereon my eyes rest so often and often so
long dream. Tomorrow I’ll take Gilbert Murray’s fine
new version of Hippolytus or Bacchæ as my pocket companion
to the Theatre of Dionysus on the hither side of
the Acropolis; possibly my favourite &OElig;dipus at Kolonos
and read sitting on Kolonos itself and imagine I hear on
the wind the rise and fall of the lonely ancient lives, serene
thought-tranced in deathless music. And in the
going of the old and the coming of the new year, a friend’s
thoughts shall fare to you from far away Athens....
As far as practicable I am keeping myself to the closer
study of the literature and philosophy and ethical concepts
and ideals of ancient Hellas and of mythology in
relation thereto, but you know how fascinating and perturbing
much else is, from sculpture to vase paintings,
from Doric and Ionic architecture to the beauty and complex
interest of the almost inexhaustible field of ancient
Greek coins, and those of Græcia Magna,&mdash;And then
(both Eheu and Evoe!) I have so much else to do&mdash;besides
“Life” the supreme and most exciting of the arts!</p>

<p class="p1">A letter of New Year wishes to Dr. Garnett from
W. S.; and a copy of <i>The House of Usna</i> to Mr. and Mrs.
Ernest Rhys brought the following acknowledgments:</p>

<div class="pbq">
<p>Your letter has given me infinite pleasure....</p>

<p>Athens must be a delightful residence at this time of
year, especially if there are no “cold snaps,” against
which I fear that the modern Athenians are no better
provided than their ancestors were. There is a very
amusing letter in Alisplorn’s epistles, describing the sufferings
of a poor parasite in a hard winter. You seem
to have very charming society. The name of Bikelas is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[377]</a></span>
well known to me, but I am not much versed in Roman
literature. The history of Paparrhegopoulos has been a
good deal noticed here of late. It seems to be a really
classical work. By producing such the Greeks will indicate
their claim to a high position in the European family,
until the time has come for action, which apparently
has not come yet.</p>

<p>I quite agree in the conclusion at which they seem to
have arrived that it is better to have the Turks in Constantinople
than the Bulgarians, much more the Russians.
If either of their victims once occupy it, the rightful
possessors will be forever excluded.</p>

<p>I have not wanted for literary occupations&mdash;one a little
work of fancy which I am about finishing, and of which
you will hear more. Then I have a story to translate
from the Portuguese, published in the <i>Venture</i>; an edition
of Browning’s preface to Shelley’s forged letters,
with an introduction by me, and the second volume of
English literature in conjunction with Gosse, which has
been these six weeks ready for issue but delayed from
time to time to suit the Americans. It is now positively
announced for the 31st.</p>

<p>With kindest regards to Mrs. Sharp, who I hope finds
Attica entirely to her taste,</p></div>

<p class="pn"><span class="smcap">Dear Miss Fiona Macleod</span>,</p>

<p class="pbq">Most delightful of all New Year’s gifts is a really beautiful
book; and we thank you,&mdash;both of us,&mdash;for sending
us your most characteristic heroic-lyric tragedy, <i>The
House of Usna</i>. We were fortunate in being allowed to
see it performed&mdash;how long ago can it have been!&mdash;at
the Stage Society’s instance.... The “Psychic Drama,”
as you conceive it, opens the door to a lost world of Nature
and the emotions of Nature in the imagination. No<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[378]</a></span>
doubt it is a frightfully difficult thing to attire these emotions
in fair and credible human dress, one that seemed
impossible even, but the “House of Usna” may serve as
a test of how far those who have the key to these emotions
can hope to fit it to old or new-old dramatic forms.
Your ‘Foreword’ is suggestive enough to be treated separately;
but we write from a sick house, and in such
states, it is harder to think of critical things than of pure
imaginative ones. For these last, as they rise out of your
magic ‘House,’ and haunt the ear, we owe you very whole
and ample thanks.</p>

<p class="pbq">With many wishes for health and spirit in this year
of 1904,</p>

<p class="pr8 reduct">We are, yours most truly,</p>
<p class="pr4 reduct"><span class="smcap">G. and E. Rhys</span>.</p>

<p class="p1">With Spring sunshine and warmth my husband
regained a degree of strength, and it was his chief
pleasure to take long rambles on the neighbouring hills
alone, or with the young American archeologist, Mrs.
Roselle L. Shields, a tireless walker. We made some
interesting expeditions to Tyrens, Mycenæ, Corinth, Delphi,
etc. and from ‘Olympia in Elis’ he wrote to a
friend:</p>

<div class="pbq">
<p class="p1">“How you would love this radiant heat, this vast solitude
of ruins, the millions of flowers and dense daisied
grass. This fragment of vast Olympia is the most ancient
Greek temple extant. It lies at the base of the Hill
of Kronos, of which the lowest pines are seen to the right
and overlooks the whole valley of the Alpheios....</p>

<p>And the millions of flowers. They are almost incredible
in number and density. The ground is often white
with thick snow of daisies. Wild plums, pears, cherries,
etc. The radiant and glowing heat is a joy. I am sad to
think that this day week beautiful Greece will be out of
sight.”</p></div>

<p class="p1">Later he wrote to Mr. Rhys:</p>

<div class="pbq">
<p>... Yesterday I had a lovely break from work, high
up on the beautiful bracing dwarf-pine clad slopes of
Pentelicos, above Kephisia, the ancient deme of Menander&mdash;and
then across the country behind Hymettos, the
country of Demosthenes, and so back by the High Convent
of St. John the Hunter, on the north spur of the Hymettian
range, and the site of ancient Gargettos, the
place of Epicurus’ birth and boyhood. At sundown I was
at Heracleion, some three or four miles from Athens&mdash;and
the city was like pale gold out of which peaked Lycabettos
rose like a purple sapphire. The sky beyond,
above Salamis, was all grass-green and mauve. A thunder-cloud
lay on extreme Hymettos, rising from Marathon:
and three rainbows lay along the violet dusk of the
great hill-range....</p>

<p>We intend to spend April in France, mostly in Southern
Provence, which we love so well, and where we have
dear French friends.</p>

<p>I am apparently well and strong again, hard at work,
hard at pleasure, hard at life, as before, and generally
once more full of hope and energy.</p>

<p class="p1">On leaving Greece we loitered at Hyères in the month
of cherry-blossoms, and moved slowly northwards
through Nîmes to the fantastic neighbourhood of Le Puy,
with its curious hill-set town and churches perched on
pinnacles of conical rock.</p>

<p class="p1">From Le Puy W. S. wrote to Mrs. Janvier:</p>

<p class="pbq p1">18th April, 1904.... What has most impressed my
imagination in this region is what I saw today outside of
fantastic Le Puy&mdash;namely at the magnificent old feudal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[380]</a></span>
rock-Chateau fortress of Polignac, erected on the site of
the famous Temple of Apollo (raised here by the Romans
on the still earlier site of a Druidic Temple to the Celtic
Sun God). I looked down the mysterious hollow of the
ancient oracle of Apollo, and realised how deep a hold
even in the France of today is maintained by the ancient
Pagan faith....</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XXV</h2>

<p class="pch">THE WINGED DESTINY</p>

<p class="pc"><i>Literary Geography</i></p>

<p class="p2">Two important events of 1904 to William Sharp were
the publication of <i>The Winged Destiny</i>, at midsummer,
by Messrs. Chapman &amp; Hall; and of his <i>Literary Geography</i>
in October.</p>

<p>In the Dedication to Dr. John Goodchild of <i>The
Winged Destiny</i> (the title of <i>The Magic Kingdoms</i> was
discarded), the author set forth ‘her’ intention:</p>

<div class="pbq">
<p class="p1">“In this book I have dealt&mdash;as I hope in all I write&mdash;only
with things among which my thought has moved,
searching, remembering, examining, sometimes dreaming....</p>

<p>It is not the night-winds in sad hearts only that I hear,
or the sighing of vain fatalities: but, often rather, of an
Emotion akin to that mysterious Sorrow of Eternity in
love with tears, of which Blake speaks in <i>Vala</i>. It is
at times, at least I feel it so, because Beauty is more
beautiful there. It is the twilight hour in the heart, as
Joy is the heart’s morning.</p>

<p>Perhaps I love best the music that leads one into the
moonlit coverts of dreams, and old silence, and unawakening
peace. But Music, like the rose of the Greeks, is
‘the thirty petalled one’ and every leaf is the gate of an
equal excellence. The fragrance of all is Joy, the beauty
of all is Sorrow: but the Rose is one&mdash;<i>Rosa Sempiterna</i>,
the Rose of Life. As to the past, it is because of what is
there, that I look back: not because I do not see what is
here today, or may be here tomorrow. It is because of
what is to be gained that I look back: of what is supremely
worth knowing there, of knowing intimately: of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[382]</a></span>
what is supremely worth remembering, of remembering
constantly: not only as an exile dreaming of the land left
behind, but as one travelling in narrow defiles who looks
back for familiar fires on the hills, or upward to the familiar
stars where is surety. In truth is not all creative
art remembrance: is not the spirit of ideal art the recapture
of what has gone away from the world, that by
an imperious spiritual law is forever withdrawing to
come again newly.”</p></div>

<p class="p1">To a friend W. S. wrote:</p>

<div class="pbq">
<p class="p1">It is a happiness to me to know that you feel so
deeply the beauty that has been so humbly and eagerly
and often despairingly sought, and that in some dim
measure, at least, is held here as a shaken image in
troubled waters. It it a long long road, the road of art
... and those who serve with passion and longing and
unceasing labour of inward thought and outward craft
are the only votaries who truly know what long and devious
roads must be taken, how many pitfalls have to be
avoided or escaped from, how many desires have to be
foregone, how many hopes have to be crucified in slow
death or more mercifully be lost by the way, before one
can stand at last on “the yellow banks where the west
wind blows,” and see, beyond, the imperishable flowers,
and hear the immortal voices.</p>

<p>A thousand perils guard the long road. And when
the secret gardens are reached, there is that other deadly
peril of which Fiona has written in “The Lynn of
Dreams.” And, yet again, there is that mysterious destiny,
that may never come, or may come to men but once,
or may come and not go, of which I wrote to you some
days ago, quoting from Fiona’s latest writing: that destiny
which puts dust upon dreams, and silence upon sweet
airs, and stills songs, and makes the hand idle, and the
spirit as foam upon the sea.</p>

<p>For the gods are jealous, O jealous and remorseless
beyond all words to tell. And there is so little time at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[383]</a></span>
the best ... and the little gain, the little frail crown, is
so apt to be gained too late for the tired votary to care,
or to do more than lie down saying ‘I have striven, and I
am glad, and now it is over, and I am glad!’</p></div>

<p class="p1">A letter of appreciation to the author from an unknown
Gaelic correspondent contained this beautiful wish:</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“May you walk by the waters of Life, and may you
rest by Still Waters, and may you know the mystery of
God.”</p>

<p class="p1">To Mrs. Helen Bartlett Bridgman, “Fiona” wrote in
acknowledgment of a letter, and of a sympathetic, printed
appreciation of <i>The Winged Destiny</i>:</p>

<p class="pn1"><span class="smcap">My dear Friend</span>,</p>

<p class="pbq">(For if deep sympathy and understanding do not constitute
friendship, what does?) It would be strange indeed
if I did not wish to write to you after what Mr.
Mosher has told me, and after perusal of what you have
written concerning what I have tried to do with my pen.
There are few things so helpful, perhaps none so pleasant
to a writer in love with his or her work and the ideals
which are its source, than the swift understanding and
sympathy of strangers. So much of my work is aside
from the general temper and taste, and not only in its
ideals but in its ‘atmosphere,’ indeed even in its writer’s
methods and manner, that I have to be content (as I
gladly am content) to let the wind that blows through
minds and hearts carry the seed whithersoever it may
perchance take root, and this with the knowledge that the
resting places must almost of necessity, as things are,
be few and far between. But it is not number that counts,
and, as I say, I am well content&mdash;would be content were
my readers far fewer than they are. It seems enough to
me that one should do one’s best in a careful beauty and
in the things of the spirit. It is enough to be a torch-bearer,
whether the flame be a small and brief light or a
beacon&mdash;it is to take over and to tend and to hand on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[384]</a></span>
fire that matters. As I say in my very shortly forthcoming
new book, <i>The Winged Destiny</i>, I desire to be of
the horizon-makers; if I can be that, however humbly,
I am glad indeed. This would be so with anyone, I
think, feeling thus. To me outside sympathy means perhaps
more; for I stand more isolated than most writers
do, partly by my will, partly by circumstances as potent
and sometimes more potent. It is not only that I am
devoid of the desire of publicity, of personal repute, and
that nothing of advantage therefrom has the slightest
appeal to me (though, alas, both health and private circumstances
make my well-being to a large extent dependent
on what my work brings me), but that I am mentally
so constituted that I should be silenced by what so
many are naturally and often rightly eager for and that
so many seek foolishly or unworthily. In this respect
I am like the mavis of the woods, that sings full-heartedly
in the morning shadow or evening twilight in secret
places, but will be dumb and lost in the general air of
noon and where many are gathered in the frequented
open to see and hear.</p>

<p class="pbq">It is for these, and other not less imperative private
reasons, why I am known personally to so very few of
my fellow-writers: and why in private circles the subject
is not one that occurs. I cannot explain, though not
from reluctance or perversity or any foolish and needless
mystery. The few who do not know me, as you know
me, but with added intimacy, are loyal in safe-guarding
my wishes and my privacy. That explains why I refuse
all editorial and other requests of “interviews,” “photographs,”
“personal articles” and the like. In a word, I
am blind to all the obvious advantages that would accrue
from my ‘entering the arena’ as others do. I have all
that frequently borne in upon me. But still less so do I
ignore what would happen to my work, to its quality and
spirit, to myself, if I yielded. I may be wrong, but I do
not think I am. I am content to do my best, as the spirit
moves me, and as my sense of beauty compels me; and
if, with that, I can also make some often much-needed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[385]</a></span>
money, enough for the need as it arises; and, further, can
win the sympathy and deep appreciation of the few intimate
and the now many unknown friends whom, to my
great gladness and pride, I have gained, then, indeed, I
can surely contentedly let wider “fame” (of all idle
things the idlest, when it is, as it commonly is, the mere
lip-repute of the curious and the shallow) go by, and be
indifferent to the lapse of possible but superfluous
greater material gain....”</p>

<p class="p1">Dr. Goodchild, after a first acknowledgment of the
dedication, again wrote to F. M.:</p>

<p class="pr5 p1 reduct"><span class="smcap">Author’s Club</span>,</p>
<p class="pr4 reduct">July 1904.</p>

<p class="pn"><span class="smcap">Dear Friend</span>,</p>

<p class="pbq">... Yesterday I read your Preface to a friend of
mine, and afterwards a lady (a clever woman I believe)
came into the room. I had never met her before, and
she had never read anything of yours, but she picked
up the book and asked what it was. “Just read the
introduction” said my friend. The reader had an expressive
face, and I wish you had seen it. “But this is
something quite new. I never read anything like it before”
she said as she finished: and I fancy that many
will do likewise.</p>

<p class="pbq">A woman said in my hearing not long ago, of one of
your poems, “<i>I</i> could not put out my heart for daws to
peck at” and I said “only the Eagle could do that, and
not only daws, but blackbirds of all kinds will come to
do that, and when the Eagles hear the call of their mates,
there will be such slaughter of carrion crows as the
World has not seen yet.”</p>

<p class="pbqr">J. A. G.</p>

<p class="p1">A few days later William described to a friend the
events of</p>

<div class="pbq">
<p class="p1">... one of the loveliest days of the year, with the
most luminous atmosphere I have seen in England&mdash;the
afternoon and evening divinely serene and beautiful.</p>

<p>I had a pleasant visit to Bath, and particularly enjoyed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[386]</a></span>
the long day spent yesterday at Glastonbury and neighbourhood,
and the glowing warmth and wonderful radiance.</p>

<p>As usual one or two strange things happened in connection
with Dr. G. We went across the ancient “Salmon”
of St. Bride, which stretches below the hill known
as “Weary-All” (a corruption of Uriel, the Angel of the
Sun), and about a mile or less westward came upon the
narrow water of the ancient ‘Burgh.’ Near here is a
very old Thorn held in great respect....</p>

<p>He put me (unknowing) to a singular test. He had
hoped with especial and deep hope that in some significant
way I would write or utter the word “Joy” on this
1st day of August (the first three weeks of vital import
to many, and apparently for myself too)&mdash;and also to see
if a certain spiritual influence would reach me. Well,
later in the day (for he could not prompt or suggest, and
had to await occurrence) we went into the lovely grounds
of the ancient ruined Abbey, one of the loveliest things
in England I think. I became restless and left him, and
went and lay down behind an angle of the East end,
under the tree. I smoked, and then rested idly, and then
began thinking of some correspondence I had forgotten.
Suddenly I turned on my right side, stared at the broken
stone of the angle, and felt vaguely moved in some way.
Abruptly and unpremeditatedly I wrote down three enigmatic
and disconnected lines. I was looking curiously at
the third when I saw Dr. G. approach.</p>

<p>“Can you make anything out of that,” I said&mdash;“I’ve
just written it, I don’t know why.” This is the triad:</p></div>

<p class="ppq6 p1">“<i>From the Silence of Time, Time’s Silence borrow.<br />
In the heart of To-day is the word of To-morrow.<br />
The Builders of Joy are the Children of Sorrow.</i>”</p>

<p class="p1">To Mr. Stedman W. S. announced our plans for the
coming winter:</p>

<p class="pbqr p1">Aug. 29, 1904.</p>

<p class="pn"><span class="smcap">Dear Poet</span>,</p>

<div class="pbq">
<p>This is not an advance birthday letter, as you may
think! It is to convey tidings of much import to my wife<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[387]</a></span>
and myself, and I hope of pleasure to you and other
friends over-sea&mdash;namely that this late autumn we are
going to pay a brief visit to New York.</p>

<p>It is our intention to spend January, February, and
March in Rome&mdash;which for me is the City of Cities. But
we are going to it via New York. In a word, we intend to
leave England somewhere between 23rd and 26th of October,
according as steamers and our needs fit it. Then
after six weeks or so in New York, we intend to sail direct
to the Mediterranean by one of the Hamburg-American
or North-German Lloyd Special Mediterranean line,
sailing to Genoa and Naples....</p>

<p>I have been very busy of late, and for one thing have
been occupied with collecting and revising the literary
studies of some years past&mdash;and much else of which I’ll
tell you when we meet. My <i>Literary Geography</i>, which
has been running serially in the <i>Pall Mall Magazine</i>
for the last 14 or 15 months will be out in book-form
in October. My wife’s recently published little book
on Rembrandt has had a good reception, I am very glad
to say.</p>

<p>With all affectionate greetings to you both, ever, Dear
Stedman,</p></div>

<p class="pr8 reduct">Affectionately your friend,</p>
<p class="pr4 reduct"><span class="smcap">William Sharp</span>.<br /></p>

<p class="p1">Before we started for New York <i>Literary Geography</i>
(by W. S.) was published. According to the critic in
<i>The World</i>:</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“It was a characteristically original idea of the author
to combine descriptions of certain localities with criticisms
and appreciations of those famous writers who had
identified themselves therewith. It gives one a fresher
and keener insight, for instance, into Mr. George Meredith’s
poems to know how much they reveal of the lovely
country in which he lives, and how many of his exquisite
similes are drawn from observation of the birds and
beasts and plants which he sees daily around his home
under the shadow of Box Hill. “The Country of Stevenson<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[388]</a></span>,”
“Dickens-Land,” “Scott-Land,” “The Country of
George Eliot,” “Thackeray-Land,” “The Brontë Country,”
“The Carlyle Country,” and “Aylwin-Land” are
all both delightful and instructive, full of poetic description,
sound criticism, and brilliant flashes of wit; and
not less so are the chapters on the “literary geography”
of the Thames from Oxford to the Nore, the English
Lakes, with all their associations with Wordsworth and
his brother poets, and the Lake of Geneva, which might
have been called Voltaire-Land were it not that so many
other famous personalities and authors are identified
with Geneva and its surroundings that the solitary distinction
might seem invidious.”</p>

<p class="p1">The book was dedicated to the author’s friend of early
days, Mr. George Halkett (then Editor of <i>The Pall Mall
Gazette</i>) with the reminder that</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“More years ago now than either of us cares to recall,
we were both, in the same dismal autumn for us, sent
wandering from our native lands in Scotland to the end
of the earth. I remember that each commiserated the
other because of that doctor’s doom in which we both,
being young and foolish, believed. Since then we have
sailed many seas and traversed many lands, and I, at
least, have the wayfaring fever too strong upon me ever
to be cured now.”</p>

<p class="p1">The critic in the <i>Daily Chronicl</i>e explained that the
“book is all an affair of temperament, and the only thing
which really matters is that Mr. Sharp has made excellent
stuff out of his impressions.... For instance, the first
time he saw Robert Louis Stevenson was not as it should
have been, in the land of Alan Breck; it was at Waterloo
Station. Is the literary geographer abashed by this conjunction
of two sympathetic Scots in a dismal London
shed? Not a bit of it:</p>

<p class="pbq p1">‘He was tall, thin, spare&mdash;indeed, he struck me as almost fantastically
spare. I remember thinking that the station draught caught him like a
torn leaf blowing at the end of a branch.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[389]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1">“Mind you, at that moment Mr. Sharp did not know
who the stranger was, but knew by instinct that the station
draught ought to make poetical use of him. More
than that, Mr. Sharp saw that Stevenson had the air of
a man just picked out of a watery grave. Anybody could
see this.</p>

<p class="pbq p1">‘That it was not merely an impression of my own was proved by the
exclamation of a cabman, who was standing beside me expectant of a
“fare” who had gone to look after his luggage: “Looks like a sooercide,
don’t he, sir? One o’ them chaps as takes their down-on-their-luck ’eaders
into the Thames!”’</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“When Stevenson could inflame a cabman with this picturesque
fantasy, no wonder he turned Waterloo Station
into the home of romance. But this was not all. The
‘sooercide’ had still more magic about him. Stevenson
was waiting for a friend to arrive by train, and when the
friend appeared, the drowned <i>revenant</i> became another
being.</p>

<p class="pbq p1">‘The dark locks apparently receded, like weedy tangle in the ebb; the
long sallow oval grew rounder and less wan; the sombre melancholy
vanished like cloud-scud on a day of wind and sun, and the dark eyes
lightened to a violet-blue and were filled with sunshine and laughter.’</p>

<p class="p1">“This extraordinary man was carrying a book and
dropped it. Then happened something which expanded
Waterloo Station into the infinite:</p>

<p class="pn"><span class="smcap">Dear Mr. Gilman</span>,</p>

<div class="pbq">
<p>Some time ago a friend played to me one or two lovely
airs by Mr. Loeffler, and I was so much impressed by their
unique quality and their atmosphere of subtle beauty that
I wrote to find out what I could about this composer, and
also about another, Mr. MacDowell, whose beautiful Keltic
Sonata I have heard. And now I have been sent a
copy of your winsome and deeply interesting and informing
little book, <i>Phases of Modern Music</i>. There I
not only find much of deep interest to me about Mr. Loeffler
and Mr. MacDowell, but find your whole book at once
informing and fascinating. In addition I had the great
pleasure of coming unexpectedly upon allusions to myself
and my writings: and I would like you to know how
truly I appreciate these, and how glad I am that a critic
touched to such fine issues in the great art of Music, and
with so keen a sense for the new ideals of beauty, the
new conceptions of style and distinction, should care for
what I am trying to do in my own art.</p>

<p>I hope you are writing another book. Whether on
musical subjects only, or on literary and musical subjects
in conjunction (which of course would appeal to a wider
section of the reading public), any such book would I
am sure, be welcomed by all who know <i>Phases of Modern
Music</i>.</p>

<p>I wish I knew more of the music of these two composers.
There is a spirit abroad just now, full of a new
poignancy of emotion, uplifted on a secret wave of passion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[391]</a></span>
and ecstasy, and these men seem to me of that small
but radiant company who have slept and dreamed in the

given me, and</p></div>

<p class="pn"><span class="smcap">My dear Miss Macleod</span>,</p>

<div class="pbq">
<p>It would not be easy for me to tell you, without seeming
extravagance, of the keen pleasure I have had in
your cordial letter concerning my book, <i>Phases of Modern
Music</i>. The deep impression which your own work
has made upon me must already have become evident to
you through even the most cursory reading of my book&mdash;an
impression the extent and definiteness of which I myself
had scarcely realised. You will know, then, how
great a satisfaction it is for me to hear that you have
been interested in my thoughts on musical subjects, and
that they have seemed to you worthy of the friendly
praise which you have spoken in your letter.</p>

<p>So you know and like the music of Loeffler and MacDowell!
That is good to hear; for few, even in this
country, where they have been active in their art for so
long, are sensible of the beauty and power of their work.
Do you know Loeffler’s latest production&mdash;“Quatre
Poëmes,” settings of verses by Verlaine and Baudelaire?
They are written for voice, piano, and viola: a singular
and admirable combination. Mr. MacDowell will be glad
to hear of your pleasure in his “Keltic Sonata,” for he
is one of your most sensitive admirers: it was he, indeed,
who first made me acquainted with your work. Have you
heard his earliest sonatas&mdash;the “Norse,” “Eroica,” and
“Tragica”? They are not very far behind the “Keltic”
in distinction and force, though lacking the import and
exaltation of the latter.</p>

<p>You would be surprised, I think, to know how the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[392]</a></span>
Celtic impulse is seizing the imaginations of some of the
younger and more warmly-tempered of American composers.
I am enclosing a programme of a concert given
recently in Boston, consisting entirely of music written
on Celtic themes.</p>

<p>Thank you again.</p></div>

<p class="p1">When in New York William Sharp had written to Mr.
Alden “on behalf of Miss Macleod” concerning her later
nature-essay work, and explained that “Some months
ago, by special request from the Editor of <i>Country Life</i>
Miss M. began contributing one or two of these papers.
From the first they attracted notice, and then the Editor
asked her if she would contribute a series to appear as
frequently as practicable&mdash;averaging two a month&mdash;till
next May when they would be issued in book-form. As
Miss M. enjoys writing them, she agreed.”</p>

<p>In the same letter he spoke of a subject on which he
had long meditated. He proposed it for <i>Harper’s Magazine</i>:&mdash;“I
have long been thinking over the material of an
article on the Fundamental Science of Criticism, to be
headed, say ‘A New Degree: D. Crit.’” This project
among many others was never worked out. But the ‘nature-papers’
were a great pleasure to him, and in 1904
and 1905 he wrote on many subjects for <i>Country Life</i>,
over the signature of F. M., also several poems that
were afterwards included in the second edition of <i>From
the Hills of Dream</i>.</p>

<p>As month by month the number of nature essays grew,
he planned to issue them in two, and later in three volumes.
To the second volume he thought to give the title
“Blue Days and Green Days” (from a line of R. L. Stevenson’s),
and to call the third, which was to deal with the
stars and the skies at night, “Beyond the Blue Septentrion.”
Not all the projected essays for each book, however,
were written; but those which appeared serially
were published posthumously in 1906, by <i>Country Life</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[393]</a></span>
under the title of <i>Where the Forest Murmurs</i>. Concerning
the titular essay, Mr. Alfred Noyes wrote: “It is one
of those pieces of nature-study which, in Matthew Arnold’s
phrase, have that rarest of all modern qualities&mdash;‘Healing
Power.’”</p>

<p>And according to <i>The Contemporary Review</i>:</p>

<p>“Fiona Macleod’s prose baffles description. It is perhaps
hardly prose at all. It is melody in words suggesting
scenes as much by sound as by the passage of ideas.
The ideas conveyed by the actual words are supplemented
by the rhythm or melody conveyed by the sequence of
words. But it is, when all analysis is ended, something
quite alone: pure music of a strange and curious quality
that is neither prose nor poetry, but thrilling with the
pain and passion of a Gaelic chant. It conveys to the
mind and heart the scenes and sounds of nature with almost
magical accuracy.”</p>

<p class="p2">The immediate object of our short visit to New York
and Boston was that I should know in person some of
the many friends my husband valued there, and I was
specially interested to make the acquaintance of Mr. and
Mrs. Stedman, who gave me a warm welcome, of Mr.
and Mrs. Alden, Mr. and Mrs. R. Watson Gilder, Mr.
John Lafarge, Mrs. Julia Ward Howe, and Miss Caroline
Hazard whom we visited at Wellesley College. But
winter set in with December. The cold proved so severe
that we sailed for and reached Naples in time to spend
Xmas Day with friends at Bordighera whence W. S. wrote
to Mr. Murray Gilchrist: “We are back from America
(thank God) and are in Italy (thank Him more)....
For myself I am crawling out of the suck of a wave
whose sweep will I hope be a big one of some months and
carry me far.”</p>

<p class="p2">In Rome we took rooms at the top of Fischer’s Park
Hotel, whence from the balconies we had a superb view
over Rome. There we saw a few friends&mdash;in particular
Mr. Hichens who was also wintering there; but my husband<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[394]</a></span>
did not feel strong enough for any social effort. As
he wrote to Mr. Mosher:</p>

<p class="pbqr p1">11th Feb., 1905.</p>

<p class="pbq">Dubious and ever varying health, with much going
to and fro in quest of what is perhaps not to be found
(for mere change of climate will not give health unless
other conditions combine to bring about the miracle)
have, among other causes, prevented my writing to you
as I had intended, or, indeed, from doing much writing
of any kind. I have written a few articles for <i>Country
Life</i>&mdash;and little else, published or unpublished. The
days go by and I say “at night”&mdash;and every night I am
too tired or listless, and say “tomorrow”: and so both
the nights and the morrows go to become thistles in the
Valley of Oblivion. But with the advancing Spring I am
regathering somewhat of lost energy, and if only I were
back in Scotland I believe I should be hard at work!
Well, I shall be there soon, though I may be away again,
in the remote isles or in Scandinavia for the late spring
and summer....</p>

<p class="p2">April my husband spent in the West of Scotland, for
which he pined; and on his way North broke his journey

<p class="pbqr p1">April, 1905.</p>

<p class="pn"><span class="smcap">Dear Mr. Robertson</span>,</p>

<div class="pbq">
<p>After our most pleasant evening à deux I had a comfortable
journey north: and last night luxuriated in getting
to bed early (a rare thing for me) with the sure and
certain knowledge there would be no glorious resurrection
therefrom at any untimely hour. So after sleeping the
sleep of the true Gael&mdash;who is said to put 85 to the poor
Sassenach 40 winks&mdash;I woke in peace. I was thereafter
having a cigarette over the <i>Scotsman</i> when my youngest
(and secretary) sister brought me my letters, papers,
etc. and with them a long narrow box which I soon discovered
to be your generous gift of 100 of these delectable
Indian cigars. It is very good of you indeed, and I
am grateful, and may the ancient Gaelic God Dia-Cheo,
God of Smoke, grant you remission of all your philological
sins and derivative ‘howlers’&mdash;and the more so as
there is no authority for any such god, and the name
would signify hill-mist instead of pipe-smoke! And may
I have a himdred ‘rèves de Notre Dame de Nicotine!’ I
couldn’t resist trying one. Wholly excellent. And in the
meditative fumes I arrived through intuition at the following
derivation which I hope will find a place in your
book:</p>

<p class="p1">From Edinburgh he and his secretary-sister Mary
went to Lismore, so that he might “feel the dear West
once more.” From Oban he reported to Mr. W. J. Robertson
on a post card addressed to “Ri Willeam Iain
MacRiobeart mhic Donnach aidh”&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“Awful accident in a lonely Isle of the West.</p>

<p>A distinguished stranger was observing the vasty deep,
and had laid a flask-filled cup on a rock beside him when
a tamned gull upset it and at same time carried off a
valuable Indian cheroot. Deep sympathy is everywhere
expressed, for the distinguished stranger, the lost cheroot,
and above all for the spilt cup and abruptly emptied
flask. A gloom has been cast over the whole island.</p>

<p class="pbqr"><i>Verb</i>: <i>Sap</i>:”</p>

<p class="p1">From Lismore he wrote to me:</p>

<div class="pbq">
<p class="p1">“<i>April 19.</i> It was sweet to fall asleep last night to the
sound of the hill-wind and the swift troubled waters. We
had a lovely walk in the late afternoon, and again in the
sombre moonlit night. It came on too stormy for me
to go round to the Cavern later, however. I’ll try again.
I was there about first dusk, with Mary. To my chagrin
there was neither sound nor sight of the sea-woman, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[397]</a></span>
she must be there for MacC. has <i>twice</i> heard her sobbing
and crying out at him when he passed close in the
black darkness. There was only a lapwing wailing near
by, but both Mary and I heard a singular furtive sound
like something in a trailing silk dress whispering to itself
as it slid past in the dusk&mdash;but this, I <i>think</i>, was a
curious echo of what’s called ‘a sobbing wave’ in some
narrow columnar hidden hollow opening from the sea.
Mary got the creeps, and loathed a story I told her about
a <i>midianmara</i> that sang lovely songs but only so as to
drown the listener and suck the white warm marrow out
of his spine.</p>

<p>Later I joined MacC. for a bit over the flickering fireflaucht.
I got him to tell me all over again and more
fully about the Maighdeann Mhara. The first time he
heard ‘something’ was before his fright last November.
‘There was <i>cèol</i> then’ he said....</p>

<p>I asked in Gaelic ‘were songs sung?’ He said ‘Yes,
at times.’ Mrs. MacC. was angry at him he said, and said
he hadn’t the common-sense of a jenny-cluckett (a clucking
hen)&mdash;<i>but</i> (and there’s a world of difference in that)
<i>she hadn’t heard what he had heard</i>. So to cheer him up
I told him a story about a crab that fed on the brains of
a drowned man, and grew with such awful and horrible
wisdom that it climbed up the stairway of the seaweed
and on to a big rock and waved its claws at the moon and
cursed God and the world, and then died raving mad.
Seeing how it worked upon him, I said I would tell him
another, and worse, about a lobster&mdash;but he was just as
bad as Mary, and said he would wait for the lobster till
the morning, and seemed so absurdly eager to get safely
to bed that the pleasant chat had to be abruptly broken
off....</p>

<p>P. S. The cold is very great, and it is a damp cold, you
couldn’t stand it. When I got up my breath <i>swarmed</i>
about the room like a clutch of phantom peewits. No
wonder I had a dream I was a seal with my feet clemmed
on to an iceberg. A duck went past a little ago seemingly
with one feather and that blown athwart its beak, so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[398]</a></span>
strong was the north-wind blowing from that snowy mass
that Ben Nevis wears like a delicate veil. Cruachan has
covered herself with a pall of snow mist.</p>

<p class="p1"><i>April 20</i>.... Fiona Macleod has just been made an
honorary member of a French League of writers devoted

letter from Paul Fort acting for his colleagues Maeterlinck,
Henri de Roquier, Jean Moréas, Emile Verhacren,
Comte Antoine de la Rochefoucault, Duchesse de la
Roche-Guyon, Richeguin, Sully Prudhomme, Henri Le
Sidaner, Jules Claretie, etc. etc.</p>

<p>We’re glad, aren’t we, you and I? She’s our daughter,
isn’t she?</p>

<p class="p1"><i>23d April</i>.... You will have got my note of yesterday
telling you that I have reluctantly had to relinquish
Iona. The primary reason is its isolation at present....</p>

<p>But from something I heard from old Mr. C. I fancy
it’s as well for me not to visit there just now, where I’d
be the only stranger, and every one would know of it&mdash;and
where a look out for F. M. or W. S. is kept! And,
too, anything heard there and afterwards utilised would
be as easily traced to me.... After Tiree and Iona and
Coll, and Arran in the South, I don’t care just now for
anywhere else&mdash;nearer: as for Eigg, which I loved so
much of old, Rum or Canna and the Outer Isles, they are
too inaccessible just now and Skye is too remote and too
wet and cold. However, it is isolation plus ‘atmosphere’
I want most of all&mdash;and I doubt if there is any place just
now I could get so much good from as Lismore. I love
that quiet isolated house on the rocks facing the Firth of
Lorne, all Appin to Ben Naomhir, and the great mountains
of Morven.</p>

<p>It was on the sandy bindweed-held slope of the little
bay near the house, facing Eilean-nan-Coarach, that F.
wrote the prelude to <i>The Winged Destiny</i>&mdash;and also
the first piece, the “Treud-nan-Ron,” which describes
that region, with Mr. MacC.’s seal legend, and the dear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[399]</a></span>
little island in the Sound of Morvern (do you remember
our row to it one day?) There one could be quiet and
given over to dreams and to the endless fascination of
outer nature.... And I have got much of what I want&mdash;the
<i>in-touch</i> above all, the atmosphere: enough to strike
the keynote throughout the coming year and more, for
I absorb through the very pores of both mind and body
like a veritable sponge. Wild-life and plant-life too extremely
interesting here. There does seem some mystery
about that cave tho’ I cannot fathom it.</p>

<p>I’ve all but finished the preparation of the new Tauchnitz
vol. (The Sunset of Old Tales) and expect to complete
it (for May) tonight.</p>

<p class="p1"><i>24th April</i>.... Yes, I was sorry to leave Lismore.
It may be my last time in the Gaelic west. (I don’t say
this “down-ly”&mdash;but because I think it likely). There
is much I want to do, and now as much by W. S. as by
F. M. and that I realise must be done abroad where alone
can I keep well and mentally even more than physically.
(<i>How</i> I hope Fontainebleau may some day suit us.)
Dear MacC. was sorry to part too. He shook hands (with
both his) and when I said in Gaelic “Goodbye, and Farewell
upon that, my friend” he said “No&mdash;no”&mdash;and then
suddenly said “My blessing on you&mdash;and goodbye now!”
and turned away and went down the pier-side and hoisted
the brown sail and went away across the water, waving a
last farewell.</p></div>

<p class="p1">The cold proved so disastrous that my husband was
ordered to Neuenahr for special treatment. Thence he
wrote to the Hon. A. Nelson Hood:</p>

<p class="pbqr">June, 1905.</p>

<p class="pn"><span class="smcap">My dear Julian</span>,</p>

<div class="pbq">
<p>Just a brief line, for I am still very restricted in permission
as to writing, as so much depends on the rest-cure
which is no small factor in my redemption here....</p>

<p>It has been ‘a narrow squeak.’ Briefly, after a hard
tussle at the brink of ‘Cape Fatal’ and a stumble across<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[400]</a></span>
‘Swamp Perilous’ I got into the merely “dangerous condition”
stage&mdash;and now at last that’s left behind, and I’ll
soon be as well in body as I’m happy and serene in mind.</p>

<p>It is at best, however, a <i>reprieve</i>, not a lifetime-discharge.
<i>N’importe</i>. Much can be done with a reprieve,
and who is to know how long the furlough may be extended
to. At any rate, I am well content.”</p></div>

<p class="p1">To me he wrote&mdash;for I was unable to accompany him:</p>

<p class="pr5 p1 reduct"><span class="smcap">Neuenahr</span>,</p>
<p class="pr4 reduct">16th June, 1905.</p>

<div class="pbq">
<p>... Here, at the Villa Usner, it is deliciously quiet and
reposeful. I had not realised to the full how much nervous
harm I’ve had for long. To live near trees is alone
a joy and a restorative. The heat is very great but to me
most welcome and strengthening.... In my room or in
the garden I hear no noise, no sounds save the susurrus
of leaves and the sweet monotony of the rushing Ahr,
and the cries and broken songs of birds....</p>

<p>I could see that Dr. G. can’t understand why I am not
more depressed or, rather, more anxious. I explained
to him that these physical troubles meant little to me,
and that they were largely the bodily effect of other
things, and might be healed far more by spiritual well-being
than by anything else: also that nature and fresh
air and serenity and light and warmth and nervous rest
were worth far more to me than all else. “But don’t you
know how serious your condition may become at any moment,
if you got a bad chill or setback, or don’t soon get
better?” “Certainly,” I said; “but what then? Why
would I bother about either living or dying? I shall not
die before the hour of my unloosening comes.”</p>

<p>I want to be helped all I may be&mdash;but all the waters
in the world can only affect the external life, and even
that only secondarily very often....</p>

<p class="p1">Monday evening.</p>

<p>... “<i>How</i> I enjoyed my breakfast this morning! (in
the lovely garden, in a vine-shadowed arbour or pergola,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[401]</a></span>
with great tall poplars and other trees billowing
against the deep blue). Then a cigarette, a stroll in the
lovely sunlit-dappled green shadowiness of an adjoining
up-sloping avenue&mdash;and a seat for a little on a deserted
south-wall bench (because of the blazing heat)
for a sun-bath, while I watched a nightingale helping its
young to fly among the creaming elders and masses of
wild-rose, while her mate swung on a beech-branch and
called long sweet exquisite cries of a thrilling poignancy
(which, however, might only be “Now then, Jenny, look
out, or Tommy will fall into that mass of syringa:&mdash;hillo!
there’s Bobby and Polly gone and got scratched pecking
at these confounded white wild-roses!).”</p>

<p>Then I got up to come in and write to you (gladly in
one way, reluctantly in another for I seem to drink in
life in the strong sunlight and heat), but first stopped
to speak to a gorgeous solitary dandelion. I stroked it
gently, and said “Hullo, wee brother, isn’t the world
beautiful? Hold up your wee head and rejoice!” And
it turned up its wee golden nose and said “Keep your
hair on, you old skidamalink, I’m rejoicing as hard as
ever I can. I’m <i>always</i> rejoicing. What else would I
do? You <i>are</i> a rum old un-shiny animal on two silly
legs!” So we laughed, and parted&mdash;but he called me
back, and said gently in a wee soft goldy-yellow voice,
“Don’t think me rude, Brother of Joy. It’s only my way.
I love you because you love <i>me</i> and don’t despise me.
Shake pinkies!”&mdash;so I gave him a pinkie and he gave
me a wee golden-yellow pinkie-petal....</p>

<p>Tell Marjorie<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> the wee Dandelion was asking about
her and sends her his love&mdash;also a milky daisy that says
<i>Hooray!</i> every morning when it wakes, and then is so
pleased and astonished that it remains silently smiling
till next morning.</p>

<p>This flower and bird talk doesn’t bother you, does it?
Don’t think I don’t realise how ill I have been and in a
small way still am: but I don’t think about it, and am

boughs and branches. From the forest-glades the cooing

wind of this delicious morning. I always gain immensely
in mind and body from nearness to woodlands and green
growth&mdash;hence in no small part my feeling for Fontainebleau.
I’d such a lot to tell you about it&mdash;and of what

of these dear friends, have not only been, and are,
a living continuous joy, but have been like the Heralds
of Spring to the return of gladness and energy into my
mind. Today I realise that too, for one thing, ‘Fiona’
has come back from afar off. It is peace and greenness
she loves&mdash;not the physical and psychical perturbation
and demoralisation of towns.</p>

<p>Yes, we’ll make ‘green homes’ for ourselves now. No
more long needless months in London....</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[403]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1">Despite his serenity of mind, London as usual wrought
him harm, and as he explained to Dr. Goodchild:</p>

<p class="pbqr p1">30th July.</p>

<p class="pbq">... August is always a ‘dark’ month for me&mdash;and
not as a rule, I fancy, a good one: at any rate an obscure
and perhaps perilous one. But this time I fancy it is on
other lines. I believe strong motives and influences are
to be at work in it perhaps furtively only: but none the
less potently and far reachingly. Between now and September-end
(perhaps longer) many of the Dark Powers
are going to make a great effort. We must all be on
guard&mdash;for there will be individual as well as racial and
general attack. But a Great Unloosening is at hand.</p>

<p class="pr8 reduct">Yours ever,</p>
<p class="pr4 reduct">W. S.<br /></p>

<p class="p1">We therefore went to Scotland to say goodbye to his
mother and sisters, and to see one or two friends, among
others, Miss Mary Wilson, the pastellist, at Bantaskine,
her home on the site of the battle of Falkirk; Mr. D. Y.
Cameron, with whom my husband planned an unfulfilled
wander among the Western Isles; and Mr. David Erskine
of Linlathen.</p>

<p>While in the North he wrote to Mr. John Maesfield:</p>

<p class="pr5 p1 reduct"><span class="smcap">Kessock Cottage,</span></p>
<p class="pr4 reduct"><span class="smcap">Nairn.</span></p>

<p class="pn"><span class="smcap">Dear Mr. Maesfield</span>,</p>

<div class="pbq">
<p>A brief word to tell you what pleasure I have had in
your little book <i>A Mainsail Haul</i>. It is not only that it
is written with delicate art: but it is rich in atmosphere&mdash;a
much rarer thing. The simplicity, the charm, the
subtle implication of floating, evasive yet fluctuating romance,
your own keen sense of the use of words and
their veiled life and latent as well as obvious colour, combine
to a winning and often compelling effect. I do not
think any who has read Don Alfonso’s drinking bout with
the little red man and the strange homegoing of the weed
and flower-grown brigantine with the Bible name, will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[404]</a></span>
forget it: and what dream charm also there is in “Port
of Many Ships,” “Sea Superstition,” “The Spanish Sailor’s
Yarn.” In such a splendid and delightful colour
fabric as “From the Spanish” “high words and rare”
are of course apt&mdash;but is it not a mistake to introduce
in “Sea Superstition” words such as “august” and
“wrought” in a sailor’s mouth? (In the text the effect
seems to be enhanced not lessened, by the omission of
these words&mdash;“were like things in bronze,” “the roof of
which was of dim branches.”)</p>

<p>In “From the Spanish” I would, as a matter of personal
taste, prefer that the end came at the close of the
penultimate para, the shore-drift of the Italian lute. I
think the strange dream-like effect would be much enhanced
without (what seems to me) the superfluous
‘realistic’ tag. Otherwise the piece is a gem of its kind.</p>

<p>But you will forgive the critic (and it shows he has
read closely) in the admirer, I hope?</p>

<p>Let us have more work of the kind. There is much
need of it, and you are of the few who can give it.</p></div>

<p class="pr8 reduct">Yours sincerely</p>
<p class="pr4 reduct"><span class="smcap">William Sharp</span>.</p>

<p class="p1">Mr. Maesfield&mdash;who had written concerning Fiona
Macleod to a friend: “I think the genius of a dead people
has found re-incarnation in her. Wherever the Celt
is, thence come visions and tears”&mdash;replied:</p>

<p class="pr5 p1 reduct"><span class="smcap">Greenwich</span>,</p>
<p class="pr4 reduct">Aug. 19, 1905.</p>

<p class="pn"><span class="smcap">Dear Mr. Sharp</span>,</p>

<div class="pbq">
<p>I was deeply touched by your kind letter about my
little book [<i>A Mainsail Haul</i>]. If it should go to a second
edition I will make use of your suggestion. I prepared
the book rather hurriedly, and there is much in it
that I very much dislike, now that it cannot be altered.</p>

<p>The mood in which I wrote the tales you like, has gone
from me, and I am afraid I shall be unable to write
others of the same kind. In youth the mind is an empty
chamber; and the spirits fill it, and move and dance there,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[405]</a></span>
and colour it with their wings and raiment. In manhood
one has familiars. But between those times (forgive me
for echoing Keats) one has little save a tag or two of
cynicism, a little crude experience, much weariness, much
regret, and a vision blurred by all four faults. One is
weakened, too, by one’s hatreds.</p>

<p>I thank you again for your very kind and cordial letter.</p></div>

<p class="pr8 reduct">Yours very sincerely,</p>

<p class="p1">To an unknown correspondent F. M. wrote:</p>

<p class="pbqr p1">Sept. 15, 1905.</p>

<div class="pbq">
<p>... I have been away, in the isles, and for a time
beyond the reach of letters. I wish there were Isles
where one could also go at times, where no winged
memories could follow. In a Gaelic folk-tale, told me
by an old woman once, the woman of the story had only
to burn a rose to ashes and to hold them in the palms of
her hands and then to say seven times <i>A Eileanain na
Sith</i>, “O Isles of Peace”! and at once she found herself
in quiet isles beyond the foam where no memories
could follow her and where old thoughts, if they
came, were like phantoms on the wind, in a moment
come, in a moment gone. I have failed to find these
Isles, and so have you: but there are three which lie
nearer, and may be reached, Dream, Forgetfulness, and
Hope.</p>

<p>And there, it may be, we can meet, you and I....</p>

<p>Yes, your insight is true. There is a personal sincerity,
the direct autobiographical utterance, in even, as
you say, the most remote and phantastic of my legends
as in the plainest of my words. But because they cover
so much illusion as well as passion, so much love gone
on the wind as well as love that not even the winds of
life and death can break or uproot, so much more of deep
sorrow (apart from the racial sorrow which breathes
through all) than of joy save in the deeper spiritual
sense, they were thus raimented in allegory and legend
and all the illusion of the past, the remote, the obscure,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[406]</a></span>
or the still simpler if more audacious directness of the
actual, the present, and the explicit. There is, perhaps,
a greater safety, a greater illusion, in absolute simplicity
than in the most subtly wrought of art....</p>

<p>But you will understand me when I say that you must
not count on our meeting&mdash;at any rate not this year. I
too stand under obscure wings.</p></div>

<p class="pr8 reduct">Your friend,</p>
<p class="pr4 reduct">F. M.</p>

<p class="p1">To the Duchess of Sutherland:</p>

<div class="pbq">
<p>... I have the memory that recalls everything in proportion
and sequence. I have often written that art is
memory, is in great part memory, though not necessarily
a recalling of mere personal experience: and the more
deeply I live the more I see that this is so....</p>

<p>When you write, I mean imaginatively, you must write
more and more with concentrated vision. Some time ago
I re-read your <i>Four Winds of the World</i>; much of it is
finely done, and in some of it your self lives, your own
accent speaks. But you have it in you to do work far
more ambitious. The last is not a word I like, or affect;
but here it is convenient and will translate to your mind
what is in my mind. These stories are <i>yours</i> but they
are not <i>you</i>: and though in a sense art is a wind above
the small eddies of personality, there is a deeper sense
in which it is nothing else than the signature of personality.
Style (that is, the outer emotion that compels and
the hidden life of the imagination that impels and the
brooding thought that shapes and colours) should, spiritually,
reflect a soul’s lineaments as faithfully as the
lens of the photographer reflects the physiognomy of a
man or woman. It is because I feel in you a deep instinct
for beauty, a deep longing for beautiful expression
and because I believe you have it in you to achieve
highly in worth and beauty, that I write to you thus....
There is that Lady of Silence, the Madonna of Enigma,
who lives in the heart of many women. Could you not
shape something under <i>Her</i> eyes&mdash;shape it and colour it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[407]</a></span>
with your own inward life, and give it all the nobler help
of austere discipline and control which is called art?
I have not much to tell you of myself just now. At the
moment I do not write to you from the beloved west
where I spend much of each year and where my thoughts
and dreams continually are. Tonight I am tired, and
sad, I hardly know why.</p></div>

<p class="pph6 p1">O wind, why break in idle foam<br />
This wave that swept the seas&mdash;...</p>
<p class="pph6">Foam is the meed of barren dreams,<br />
And hearts that cry for peace.</p>

<p class="pph6 p1">Lift then, O wind, this heart of mine<br />
And swirl aside in foam&mdash;</p>
<p class="pph6">No, wander on, unchanging heart,<br />
The undrowning deeps thy home.</p>

<p class="pph6 p1">Less than a billow of the sea<br />
That at the last doth no more roam</p>
<p class="pph6">Less than a wave, less than a wave<br />
This thing that hath no home</p>
<p class="pph6">This thing that hath no grave!</p>

<p class="pbq p1">But I shall weary you. Well, forgive me....</p>

<p class="p1">The next letter is to Mrs. Helen Hopekirk, the Scottish-American
composer, who has set several of the F. M.
poems to music:</p>

<p class="pbqr p1">18th Oct., 1905.</p>

<p class="pn"><span class="smcap">My dear Mrs. Hopekirk</span>,</p>

<p class="pbq">I was very pleased to hear from you again. I am busy
with preparations for Italy, for the doctors say I should
be away from our damp Scottish climate from October-end
till Spring comes again. How far off it seems....
Spring! Do you long for it, do you love its advent, as
I do? Wherever I am, St. Bride’s Day is always for me
the joy-festival of the year&mdash;the day when the real new
year is born, and the three dark months are gone, and
Spring leans across the often gray and wet, but often
rainbow-lit, green-tremulous horizons of February. This
year it seems a longer way off than hitherto, and yet it
should not be so&mdash;for I go to Italy, and to friends, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[408]</a></span>
to beautiful places in the sun, there and in Sicily, and
perhaps in Algeria. But, somehow, I care less for these
than I did a few years ago, than two or three years ago,
than a year ago. I think outward change matters less
and less as the imagination deepens and as the spirit
more and more “turns westward.” I love the South:
and in much, and for much, am happy there: but as the
fatally swift months slip into the dark I realise more
and more that it is better to live a briefer while at a high
reach of the spirit and the uplifted if overwrought physical
part of one than to save the body and soothe the
mind by the illusions of physical indolence and mental
leisure afforded by long sojourns in the sunlands of the
South....</p>

<p class="pbq">How I wish I knew Loeffler and Debussy and others
as you do: but then, though I love music, tho’ it is one
of the vital things in life for me, I am not a musician,
alas. So even if I had all their music beside me it would
be like a foreign language that must be read in translation.
Do you realise&mdash;I suppose you do&mdash;how fortunate
you are in being your own interpreter. Some day, however,
I hope to know intimately all those wonderful settings
of Verlaine and Baudelaire and Mallarmé and
others. The verbal music of these is a ceaseless pleasure
to me. I have a great love of and joy in all later French
poetry, and can never understand common attitude to
it here&mdash;either one of ignorance, or patronage, or complete
misapprehension. Because of the obvious fact that
French is not so poetic a language as English or German,
in scale, sonority, or richness of vocabulary&mdash;it is,
indeed, in the last respect the poorest I believe of all
European languages as English is by far the richest&mdash;people,
and even those who should be better informed,
jump to the conclusion that therefore all French poetry
is artificial or monotonously alike, or, at best, far inferior
to English. So far as I can judge, finer poetry has
been produced in France of late years than in England,
and very much finer than any I know in Germany. However,
the habitual error of judgment is mainly due to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">[409]</a></span>
ignorance: that, and the all but universal unfamiliarity
with French save in its conventional usage, spoken or
written....</p>

<p class="p1">“Fiona” received that summer, from Mr. Yoni Noguchi,
a volume entitled <i>From the Eastern Sea</i> by that
Japanese author, and sent acknowledgment:</p>

<p class="pbqr p1"><span class="smcap">On the Mediterranean.</span></p>

<p class="pn"><span class="smcap">Dear Mr. Noguchi</span>,</p>

<p class="pbq">Your note and delightful little book reached me, after
considerable delay, in southern Europe. I write this
at sea, and will send it with other letters, etc., to be
stamped and posted in Edinburgh&mdash;and the two reasons
of delay will show you that it is not from indolence!</p>

<p class="pbq">I have read your book with singular pleasure. What
it lacks in form (an inevitable lack, in the circumstances)
it offers in essential poetry. I find atmosphere and
charm and colour and naïveté, and the true touch of the
poet; and congratulate you on your ‘success of suggestion’
in a language so different in all ways from that
wherein (I am sure) you have already achieved the ‘success
of finality.’</p>

<p class="pr6 reduct">Believe me, yours very truly,</p>
<p class="pr4 reduct"><span class="smcap">Fiona Macleod</span>.<br /></p>

<p class="p1">Later, Mr. Noguchi sent his subsequent book <i>The
Summer Cloud</i>, a collection of short prose-poems, which,
as he explained in his note of presentation: “In fact, I
had been reading your prose-poems, <i>The Silence of
Amor</i>, and wished I could write such pieces myself. And
here is the result!”</p>

<p class="p2">It was our habit, when talking to one another of the
“F. M.” writings, to speak of “Fiona” as a separate
entity&mdash;so that we should not be taken unawares if suddenly
spoken to about ‘her’ books. It was William’s
habit also to write and post to himself two letters on
his birthday&mdash;letters of admonition and of new resolutions.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[410]</a></span>
On the 12th Sep. 1905 he brought me the two
birthday letters when they reached him, and gave them
to me to read, saying, with a smile, “Fiona is rather hard
on me, but she is quite right.” Both letters are in his
handwriting and are as follows:</p>


<p class="p1"><span class="smcap">Gu Fionaghal nic Leoid</span></p>
<p class="pi2"><span class="smcap">Sliabhean n’an Aisling</span></p>
<p><i>Y-Breasil</i> (<span class="smcap">na Tir-fo-Tuinn</span>)</p>

<p class="pr5 reduct"><span class="smcap">An Domhain Uaine</span>,</p>
<p class="pr4 reduct">12th Sept., 1905.</p>

<p class="pn"><span class="smcap">Dearest Fiona</span>,</p>

<p class="pbq">A word of loving greeting to you on the morrow of our
new year. All that is best in this past year is due to
<i>you</i>, mo caraid dileas: and I hope and believe that seeds
have been sown which will be reborn in flower and fruit
and may be green grass in waste places and may even
grow to forests. I have not always your serene faith
and austere eyes, dear, but I come to much in and thro’
my weakness as you through your strength. But in this
past year I realise I have not helped you nearly as much
as I could: in this coming year I pray, and hope, it may
be otherwise. And this none the less tho’ I have much
else I want to do apart from <i>our</i> work. But we’ll be
one and the same <i>au fond</i> even then, shall we not, Fiona
dear?</p>

<p class="pbq">I am intensely interested in the fuller development of
the Celtic Trilogy&mdash;and shall help in all ways. You say
I can give you what you have not: well, I am glad indeed.
Together we shall be good <i>Sowers</i>, Fionaghal mo
rùn: and let us work contentedly at <i>that</i>. I wish you
Joy and Sorrow, Peace, and Unrest, and Leisure, Sun,
and Wind, and Rain, all of Earth and Sea and Sky in
this coming year. And inwardly dwell with me, so that
less and less I may fall short of your need as well as
your ideal. And may our “Mystic’s Prayer” be true
for us both, who are one.</p>

<p class="pr8 reduct">Ever yours, dear,</p>

<p class="pr4 reduct"><span class="smcap">Y-Breasil.</span></p>

<p class="pn"><span class="smcap">My dear Will</span>,</p>

<p class="pbq">Another birthday has come, and I must frankly say
that apart from the loss of another year, and from what
the year has brought you in love and friendship and all
that makes up life, it has not been to your credit. True,
you have been in America and Italy and France and
Scotland and England and Germany&mdash;and so have not
been long settled anywhere&mdash;and true also that for a
month or two you were seriously and for a few months
partially ill or ‘down’&mdash;but still, after all allowances, I
note not only an extraordinary indolence in effort as well
as unmistakable laziness in achievement. Now, either
you are growing old (in which case admit dotage, and
be done with it) or else you are permitting yourself to
remain weakly in futile havens of ignoble repose or fretful
pseudo rest. You have much to do, or that you ought
to do, yourself: and as to <i>our</i> collaboration I see no way
for its continuance unless you will abrogate much of
what is superfluous, curtail much that can quite well be
curtailed, and generally serve me loyally as I in my turn
allow for and serve <i>you</i>.</p>

<p class="pbq">Let our New Year be a very different one from the
last, dear friend: and let us not only beautifully dream
but <i>achieve</i> in beauty. Let the ignoble pass, and the
noble remain.</p>

<p class="pr8 reduct">Lovingly yours, dear Will,</p>

<p>Some of his own copies of his F. M. books have an
inscription to “W. S.” from his twin self. For instance,
his specially bound copy of <i>The Winged Destiny</i> bears
this inscription in his handwriting:
and is dated 12th Sept., 1904. But William did not write
or sign his F. M. letters himself. When not typed by
him, they were copied and signed for him by his sister
Mary, in whose handwriting is the following signature&mdash;familiar
to F. M.’s correspondents:</p>

<p>In the beginning of October we left London accompanied
by Miss Mary Wilson and went to Venice by way
of Zurich and Innsbruck. Then to Florence to stay with
our friends Mr. and Mrs. Lee Hamilton, and finally, to
Sicily.</p>

<p>Taormina was beautifully sunny and restful as of
yore; and the delicate man rejoiced greatly in the beautiful
gardens that the Duke of Bronte was designing and
planting with flowers and trees, on the slopes of the hillside
below the town.</p>

<p>A letter reached him there from Mr. Hichens:</p>

<p class="pr5 p1 reduct"><span class="smcap">St. Stephen’s,</span></p>
<p class="pr4 reduct"><span class="smcap">Canterbury.</span></p>

<p class="pn"><span class="smcap">Oh, my dear Will</span>,</p>

<p class="pbq">I cannot help envying you. It is bitterly cold here,
like winter, and neuralgia is flitting about my twitching
face and shrinking head. But I will not inflict my little
woes upon you, and only write this word to say I am
sending you my book <i>The Black Spaniel</i>. It is a very
slight and mixed affair this time&mdash;my last book of stories
I think. The new novel I have some hopes of your
liking, as I hope I have imprisoned something of our beloved
Sicily in it. Now I am doing the last act&mdash;the last
to be done, I mean, of my play for Wyndham. Yes, we
will meet in Africa, if the gods are kind. I expect to
leave England for Rome on Dec. 3. I am looking forward
to Biskra immensely but must try to settle in there
as <i>must</i> be working then.... How are you both? Happy
in the sun? All blessings upon you and your work.</p>

<p class="pr6 reduct">Ever yours affectionately,</p>
<p class="pr4 reduct"><span class="smcap">Roberto</span>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">[413]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1">It had been planned that after the New Year Mr.
Hood, Mr. Hichens, my husband and I should go together
to Biskra. But as the autumn waned, we realised the
unwisdom of making any such plans. On hearing of
our reluctant decision Mr. Hichens wrote:</p>

<p class="pbqr p1">Nov., 1905.</p>

<p class="pn"><span class="smcap">My dear Will</span>,</p>

<p class="pbq">Your letter was really a blow, but of course I thoroughly
understand that you must not risk such a journey.
I am grieved about your delicate health. You must take
great care and stay in places where you can have your
comforts. I wish Rome suited you both. I am suffering
from London dyspepsia. Today there is a thick fog and
I envy you all tremendously. I am counting the days
till I can start for Rome. How is Taormina? Alec describes
it as warm and splendid, and pretends that he
needs a sun umbrella and a straw hat! Perhaps you
are all bathing in the sea! Oh, these travellers’ tales!
I am going out to bathe in the fog, so au revoir. Love
to you both, kindest regards to Etna from</p>

<p class="pr6 reduct">Yours ever affectionately,</p>
<p class="pr4 reduct"><span class="smcap">Roberto</span>.</p>

<p class="p1">During one of our visits to Maniace Mr. Hichens was
also a guest; on a subsequent visit to that lava-strewn
country, on the great western slope of the shoulder of
Etna, he wrote to me, in 1906, about my husband: “I
have had many walks here with Will. I think my last
long walk with him here was towards Maletto. We
sat on a rock for a long while, looking at the snow on
Ætna and the wild country all around. We talked about
death, and he said he loved life but he did not fear death
at all. I remember well how alive his eyes looked.
He always had a very peculiar look of life in the eyes,
an unquenchable vitality.”</p>

<p class="p1">On reaching Maniace W. S. wrote to a friend:</p>

<p class="pbqr p1">Dec. 4, 1905.</p>

<p class="pbq">... As my card of yesterday will have told you we
arrived here all right on Monday afternoon, after a wonderful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">[414]</a></span>
journey. We left Taormina in a glory of midsummerlike
warmth and beauty&mdash;and we drove down
the three miles of winding road from Taormina to the
sea at Giardini; thence past the bay and promontory of
Naxos, and at the site of the ancient famous fane of
Apollo Archagêtês turned inland. Then through the
myriad lemon-groves of Al Cantara, till we crossed the
gorges of the Fiumefreddo, and then began the long ascent,
in blazing heat, by the beautiful hill road to the
picturesque mountain-town of Piedemonte. There we
caught the little circum-Ætnean mountain loop-line, and
ascended the wild and beautiful slopes of Etna. Last
time we went we travelled mostly above the clouds, but
this time there was not a vestige of vapour in the radiant
air, save for the outriders’ trail of white, occasionally
flame-coloured, smoke from the vast 4-mile wide mouth
of snow-white and gigantically-looming cone of Etna.
At the lofty mediæval and semi-barbaric town of Randazzo
we were delayed by an excited crowd at the station,
on account of the arrest and bringing in by the
carabinieri of three chained and heavily manacled brigands,
one of them a murderer, who evidently had the
sympathy of the populace. A woman, the wife of one
of the captured men, outdid any lamenting Irish woman
I ever saw: her frenzy was terrible&mdash;and of course the
poor soul was life-desolate and probably punished and
would likely never see her man again. Finally she became
distracted with despair and fury, and between her
appeals and furious curses and almost maniacal lamentations,
the small station was anything but an agreeable
stopping place. The captive brigands were absolutely
impassive: not a glance: only, as the small train puffed
onward, one of them lifted a manacled arm behind one
of the carabinieri and made a singular sign to some one.</p>

<p class="pbq">Thereafter we passed into the wild and terrible lava-lands
of the last frightful eruption, between Randazzo
and the frontier of the Duchy of Bronte: a region as
wild and fantastic as anything imagined by Doré, and
almost terrifying in its sombre deathfulness. The great
and broad and sweeping mountains, and a mighty strath&mdash;and
we came under the peaked rocks of Maletto, a
little town standing 3000 feet high. Then the carriage,
and the armed escort, and we had that wonderful drive
thro’ wild and beautiful lands of which I have heretofore
written you. Then about four we drove up to the
gates of the Castle, and passed into the great court just
within the gates, and had the cordial and affectionate
welcome of our dear host.</p>

<p class="pbq">A few minutes later we were no longer at an ancient
castle in the wilds of Sicily, but in a luxurious English
country house at afternoon tea....</p>

<p class="p1">My husband had taken with him, as material for the
winter’s work, his notes for the <i>Greek Backgrounds</i>,
and the finished drafts of two dramas. One, by W. S.,
was to be called <i>Persephonæia, or the Drama of the
House of Ætna</i>, and of it one act and one scene had been
written at Maniace two years before. It was to have
been dedicated to The Duke of Bronte. The other drama
was Fiona’s projected play <i>The Enchanted Valleys</i>, of
which one scene only was written. But he felt unable
for steady work, as the following letter to the same
friend, shows:</p>

<p class="pbq p1">... A single long letter means no work for me that
day, and the need of work terribly presses, and in
every way, alas. My hope that I might be able for
some writing in the late afternoon, and especially from 5
to 7.30 is at present futile. I simply can’t. Yesterday I
felt better and more mentally alert than I’ve done since
I came, and immediately after afternoon tea, I came to
my study and tried to work, but could not, though I had
one of my nature articles begun and beside me: nor had
I spirit to take up my reviews: then I thought I could
at least get some of that wearisome accumulated correspondence
worked off, but a mental nausea seized me, so
that even a written chat to a friend seemed to me too
exhausting. C’est cette maladie poignante, ce “degoût<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">[416]</a></span>
de la plume,” que Tourgenieff (ou Flaubert?) parlait de
son c&oelig;ur frappé. So I collapsed, and dreamed over a
strange and fascinating ancient-world book by Lichtenberger,
and then dreamed idly, watching the flaming oak-logs.”</p>

<p class="p1">In William’s Diary for December there are the following
entries:</p>

<div class="pbq">
<p class="p1"><i>1st. Friday.</i> Wrote the short poem “When greenness
comes again.” Read Zola’s wearisome “His Excellency
Eugène Rougon,” and in the evening the “Jupiter” and
“Saturn” chapters in Proctor’s “Otherworlds Than
Ours.”</p>

<p><i>2d. Saty.</i> Read and took notes and thought out my
Country Life article on “At the Turn of the Year.” Also
incidentally “The Clans of the Rush, the Reed, and the
Fern,” and one to be called “White Weather” (snow,
the wild goose and the wild swan). Alec and I walked
to the Boschetto. Began (about 1300 words) “At the
Turn of the Year.”</p>

<p><i>3rd. Sunday.</i> A stormy and disagreeable day. Wrote
long letters. In afternoon felt too tired and too sleepy
to work or even to write letters: so sat before the fire
in my study and partly over that fascinating book I
love often to recur to for a few pages, Lichtenberger’s
<i>Centaures</i>, and partly in old dreams of my own, it was
7.30 and time to dress before I knew it. Heard today
from Ernest Rhys about the production of his and Vincent
Thomas’ Opera <i>Guinevere</i>. Thought over an old
world book to be called <i>Beyond the Foam</i>.</p>

<p><i>Dec. 4th.</i> In the forenoon began again and wrote
first thousand words of “At the Turn of the Year.”
At 3 went to drive with Elizabeth along the Balzo to
near the Lake of Garrida.</p>

<p><i>Dec. 5. Tuesday.</i> In forenoon wrote the remaining
and large half of “At the Turn of the Year”: revised
the whole of it and posted it to Mary, with long
letter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">[417]</a></span></p>

<p>In afternoon a drive, despite the wet and inclement
weather, up to Maletto. I walked back. A lovely, if
unsettled sunset of blue and gold, purple brown, amethyst,
and delicate cinnamon. A marvellous light on
the hills. Luminous mist instead of cloud as of late.
For the first time have seen the Sicilian Highlands with
the beauty of Scotland.</p>

<p>From 10 till 11.30 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span> worked at notes for “White
Weather” article.</p>

<p><i>Dec. 6. Wed.</i> In the forenoon worked at Gaelic material
partly for articles, partly for other things. But
not up to writing. There is a sudden change to an April-like
heat: damply-hot; though fine: very trying, all feel
it. After lunch walked up the north heights with Alec,
then joined E. and D. L. in carriage and drove up past
Otaheite to the Saw-Mills. Lovely air, gorgeous windy
sky in the west, and superb but thunderous clouds in S.
and E. Another bad change I fear. Etna rose gigantic
as we ascended Otaheite-way, and from Serraspina
looked like an immense Phantom with a vast plume of
white smoke.</p>

<p>In afternoon (from 5.30 till 7.30) wrote 1200 words of
“White Weather.”</p>

<p><i>Thursday. 7th.</i> This morning fresh and bright and
clear, a welcome change from these recent days&mdash;with
the Beechwoods all frosted with snow. The Simeto
swollen to a big rushing river.</p>

<p>Worked at and finished the latter part of “White
Weather,” and then revised and sent off to Mary to forward
with note to <i>Country Life</i>. Also other letters.
Turned out the wettest and worst afternoon we’ve had
yet, and return of severe thunderstorm.</p>

<p><i>Dec. 8. Friday.</i> A fine morning but very doubtful if
yet settled. Went out and was taken by Beek to see the
observatory instruments and wind-registers and seismographs.
Then took the dogs for a walk, as “off” work
today.</p>

<p>Wrote a long letter to Robert Hichens, also to R. L. S.
Also, with poem “When Greenness comes again” by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">[418]</a></span>
W. S. to C. Morley <i>Pall Mall Magazine</i>. In afternoon
we had a lovely drive up above the Alcantara Valley
along the mountain road toward Cesaro.”</p></div>

<p class="p1">And here the Diary ends, and here too ends the written
work of a tired hand and brain, but of an eager
outlooking spirit. Ever since we left London it was evident
that his life forces were on the ebb-tide slowly but
surely; and he knew it, but concerned himself little, and
believed he had at any rate a few months before him
and possibly a whole year. Yet he seemed to have an
inner knowledge of what was to be. In Scotland, in the
summer, he told me it would be his last visit there; that
he knew it, and had said farewell to his mother. On
the afternoon when we drove up to the Saw-Mills in the
oak-woods he got out of the carriage and wandered
among the trees. When I urged him to come away,
as the light was waning rapidly, he touched the trees
again and again and said, “Ah dear trees of the North,
dear trees of the North, goodbye.” The drive on the
8th, so beautiful, to him so full of fascination, was fatal
to him. We drove far along a mountain pass and at the
furthest point stopped to let him look at the superb
sunset over against the hillset town of Cesaro.</p>

<p>He seemed wrapt in thought and looked long and steadfastly
at the wonderful glowing light; it was with difficulty
that I persuaded him to let us return. On the
way back, a sudden turn of the road brought us in face
to the snow covered cone of Ætna. The wind had changed
and blew with cutting cold straight off the snow. It
struck him, chilling him through and through. Half way
back he got out of the carriage to walk and get warm.
But the harm was done. That evening, before dinner,
he said to me: “I am going to talk as much as I can tonight.
That dear fellow Alec is rather depressed. I’ve
teased him a good deal today; now I am going to amuse
him.” He was as good as his word, anecdote, reminiscence,
followed one another told in the gayest of spirits,
and in saying goodnight to me our host declared, “I have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">[419]</a></span>
never heard Will more brilliant than he has been tonight.”</p>

<p>The next morning my husband complained of pain
which grew rapidly more severe. The doctor was sent
for, and remained in the house.</p>

<p>On the morning of the 12th&mdash;a day of wild storm, wind,
thunder and rain&mdash;he recognised that nothing could
avail. With characteristic swiftness he turned his eager
mind from the life that was closing to the life of greater
possibilities that he knew awaited him. About 3 o’clock,
with his devoted friend Alec Hood by his side, he suddenly
leant forward with shining eyes and exclaimed in
a tone of joyous recognition, “Oh, the beautiful ‘Green
Life’ again!” and the next moment sank back in my
arms with the contented sigh, “Ah, all is well.”</p>

<p>On the 14th, in an hour of lovely sunshine, the body
was laid to rest in a little woodland burial-ground on the
hillside within sound of the Simeto; as part of the short
service, his own “Invocation to Peace,” from <i>The Dominion
of Dreams</i>, was read over the grave by the Duke
of Bronte. Later, an Iona cross, carved in lava, was
placed there, and on it this inscription, chosen by himself:</p>

<p class="ppn8 p1">Farewell to the known and exhausted,<br />
Welcome the unknown and illimitable</p>

<p class="p1">and</p>

<p class="ppn4 p1">
Love is more great than we conceive, and Death is the keeper
of unknown redemptions.</p>

<p class="pbqr">F. M.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">[420]</a></span></p>

<p class="pbqn p4"><i>Now, truly, is Dreamland no longer a phantasy of sleep,
but a loveliness so great that, like deep music, there could
be no words wherewith to measure it, but only the breathless
unspoken speech of the soul upon whom has fallen the secret
dews</i>.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XXVII</h2>

<p class="pch">CONCLUSION</p>

<p>“How the man subdivided his soul is the mystery,”
wrote Mr. James Douglas. And in trying to suggest an
answer I would say with “F. M.”&mdash;“I write, not because
I know a mystery and would reveal it, but because I
have known a mystery, and am to-day as a child before
it, and can neither reveal nor interpret it.” For that
mystery concerns the evolution of a human soul; and
the part of it for which ‘the man’ is consciously and
personally responsible, is the method he used, the fiction
he created and deliberately fostered,&mdash;rightly or wrongly&mdash;for
the protection of his inner, compelling self.</p>

<p>This deliberate ‘blind’&mdash;which according to some
critics “is William Sharp’s most notable achievement in
fiction rather than the creation of any of ‘her’ works”&mdash;is
largely the cause of the sense of confusion that exists
in the minds of certain of his friends, to whom he told the
half but not the whole of the facts. He purposely did not
dispel the idea of a collaborator, an idea which grew out
of the half veiled allusions he had made concerning the
friend of whom I have written, whose vivid personality
appealed so potently to a phase of his complex nature,
and stirred his imagination as no one else had done.</p>

<p>In a letter to Mr. W. B. Yeats signed “Fiona Macleod,”
and written in 1899, about herself and her friend (namely
himself) William tried “as far as is practicable in a
strange and complex manner to be explicit.” ‘She’
stated that, “all the formative and expressional as well as
nearly all the visionary power is my friends. In a sense
only his is the passive part, but it is the allegory of the
match, the wind, and the torch. Everything is in the
torch in readiness, and as you know, there is nothing in
the match itself. But there is a mysterious latency of fire<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">[422]</a></span>
between them ... the little touch of silent igneous potency
at the end of the match&mdash;and in what these symbolise,
one adds spiritual affinity as a factor&mdash;and all at
once the flame is born. The torch says all is due to the
match. The match knows the flame is not hers. But beyond
both is the wind, the spiritual air. Out of the
unseen world it fans the flame. In that mysterious air
both the match and the flame hear strange voices. The
air that came at the union of both is sometimes Art,
sometimes Genius, sometimes Imagination, sometimes
Life, sometimes the Spirit. It is all.</p>

<p>“But before that flame people wonder and admire.
Most wonder only at the torch. A few look for the
match beyond the torch, and finding her are apt to attribute
to her that which is not hers, save as a spiritual
dynamic agent. Now and then the match may have <i>in
petto</i> the qualities of the torch&mdash;particularly memory and
vision: and so can stimulate and amplify the imaginative
life of the torch. But the torch is at once the passive,
the formative, the mnemonic, and the artistically
and imaginatively creative force. He knows that in one
sense he would be flameless or at least without that ideal
blend of the white and the red&mdash;without the match: and
he knows that the flame is the offspring of both, that the
wind has many airs in it, and that one of the most potent
is that which blows from the life and mind and soul of
‘the match’&mdash;but in his heart he knows that, to all others,
he and he alone is the flame, his alone both the visionary,
the formative, the expressional.”</p>

<p>At the last, realising with deep regret that one or two
of the friends he cared greatly for would probably feel
hurt when they should know of the deception, he left
the following note to be sent to each immediately on the
disclosure of the secret:</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“This will reach you after my death. You will think
I have wholly deceived you about Fiona Macleod. But,
in an intimate sense this is not so: though (and inevitably)
in certain details I have misled you. Only, it is a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">[423]</a></span>
mystery. I cannot explain. Perhaps you will intuitively
understand or may come to understand. “The rest is
silence.” Farewell.</p>

<p class="pbqr"><span class="smcap">William Sharp.</span></p>

<p class="pbq">It is only right, however, to add that I, and I only,
was the author&mdash;in the literal and literary sense&mdash;of all
written under the name of “Fiona Macleod.”</p>

<p class="p1">In watching the development of the “Fiona Macleod”
phase of expression it has seemed to me that the writer,
in that work, lived a new sequent life, and passed through
its successive phases of growth and development independently
of the tenor of his ordinary life as “W. S.”
He passed from the youth in <i>Pharais</i> and <i>The Mountain
Lovers</i>, through the mature manhood of <i>The Barbaric
Tales and Tragic Romances</i> to the greater serenity of
later contemplative life in <i>The Divine Adventure</i>, <i>The
Winged Destiny</i> and <i>Where the Forest Murmurs</i>.</p>

<p>In surveying the dual life as a whole I have seen how,
from the early partially realised twin-ship, “W. S.” was
the first to go adventuring and find himself, while his
twin, “F. M.,” remained passive, or a separate self.
When “she” awoke to active consciousness “she” became
the deeper, the more impelling, the more essential
factor. By reason of this severance, and of the acute
conflict that at times resulted therefrom, the flaming of
the dual life became so fierce that “Wilfion”&mdash;as I
named the inner and third Self that lay behind that dual
expression&mdash;realised the imperativeness of gaining control
over his two separated selves and of bringing them
into some kind of conscious harmony. This was what he
meant when he wrote to Mrs. Janvier in 1899, “I am going
through a new birth.”</p>

<p>For, though the difference between the two literary expressions
was so marked, there was, nevertheless, a
special characteristic of “Wilfion” that linked the dual
nature together&mdash;the psychic quality of seership if I may
so call it. Not only did he, as F. M. “dream dreams”
and “get in touch with the ancient memory of the race<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">[424]</a></span>”
as some of ‘her’ critics have said; but as W. S. he
also saw visions by means of that seership with which
he had been dowered from childhood. And though, latterly,
he gave expression to it only under shelter of the
Fiona Macleod writings&mdash;as for instance in <i>The Divine
Adventure</i>, because he was as sensitive about it as he
was to the subtler, more imaginative side of his dual
self&mdash;a few of his friends knew William Sharp as psychic
and mystic, who knew nothing of him as Fiona Macleod.</p>

<p>I have said little concerning my husband as a psychic;
a characteristic that is amply witnessed to in his writings.
From time to time he interested himself in definite
psychic experimentation, occasionally in collaboration
with Mr. W. B. Yeats; experimentation that sometimes
resulted in such serious physical disturbance that he
desisted from it in later years.</p>

<p>In a lecture given by Mr. Yeats to the Aberdeen Centre
of the Franco-Scottish Society in 1907 the Irish poet
referred to his friend. He considered that “Sharp had in
many ways an extraordinarily primitive mind. He was
fond of speaking of himself as the representative of the
old bards,” and the Irish poet thought there was really
something in the claim. (In a letter Mr. Yeats had expressed
his opinion that my husband was imaginative
in “the old and literal sense of image-making; not
like a man of this age at all.”) He continued that
W. S. was the most extraordinary psychic he had ever
encountered. He really believed that “Fiona Macleod
was a secondary personality&mdash;as distinct a secondary
personality as those one reads about in books
of psychical research. At times he (W. S.) was really
to all intents and purposes a different being.” He
would “come and sit down by my fireside and talk, and
I believe that when ‘Fiona Macleod’ left the house he
would have no recollection of what he had been saying
to me.”</p>

<p>It is true, as I have said, that William Sharp seemed
a different person when the Fiona mood was on him; but
that he had no recollection of what he said in that mood<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425">[425]</a></span>
was not the case. That he did not understand it, is true.
For that mood could not be commanded at will. Different
influences awakened it, and its duration depended
largely on environment. “W. S.” could set himself
deliberately to work normally, and was, so far, master
of his mind. But for the expression of the “F. M.”
self he had to wait upon mood, or seek conditions to induce
it. But, as I have said, the psychic, visionary power
belonged exclusively to neither; it influenced both, and
was dictated by laws he did not fully understand. For
instance, “Lilith,” “The Whisperer,” “Finis,” by W. S.
and “The Woman with the Net,” “The Last Supper,”
“The Lynn of Dreams” by F. M., were equally the result
of direct vision.</p>

<p>I remember from early days how he would speak of
the momentary curious “dazzle in the brain” which preceded
the falling away of all material things and preluded
some inner vision of Great Beauty, or Great Presences,
or of some symbolic import&mdash;that would pass as
rapidly as it came. I have been beside him when he
has been in trance and I have felt the room throb with
heightened vibration. I regret now that I never wrote
down such experiences at the time. They were not
infrequent, and formed a definite feature in our life.
There are, however, two or three dream-visions belonging
to his last summer that I recollect. Two he had noted
down in brief sentences for future use. One was:</p>

<p>“The Lily of the World, and its dark concave, dark
with excess of light and the stars falling like slow rain.”</p>

<p>The other is headed “Elemental Symbolism,” “I saw
Self, or Life, symbolised all about me as a limitless,
fathomless and lonely sea. I took a handful and threw
it into the grey silence of ocean air, and it returned at
once as a swift and potent flame, a red fire crested with
blown sunrise, rushing from between the lips of sky and
sea to the sound as of innumerable trumpets.”</p>

<p>One morning he told me that during sleep he had visited
a city of psychic mechanism. In a huge building he
had seen this silent mechanism at work; he had watched<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">[426]</a></span>
a force plunge into molten metal and produce a shaped
vessel therefrom. He could see nothing that indicated
by what power the machinery was driven. He asked his
guide for explanation, and he was led along passages
to a small room with many apertures in the walls, like
speaking tubes. In the centre was a table, on a chair
sat a man with his arm on the table, his head in his
hand. Pointing to him the guide said “His thought is
the motive force.”</p>

<p>In another dream he visited a land where there was no
more war, where all men and women were equal; where
humans, birds and beasts were no longer at enmity, or
preyed on one another. And he was told that the young
men of the land had to serve two years as missionaries to
those who lived at the uttermost boundaries. “To what
end?” he asked. “To cast out fear, our last enemy.”
The dream is too long to quote in its entirety, for it
spread over two nights, but one thing impressed him
greatly. In the house of his host he was struck by the
beauty of a framed painting that seemed to vibrate with
rich colour. “Who painted that?” he asked. “His
host smiled, “We have long ceased to use brushes and
paints. That is a thought projected from the artist’s
brain, and its duration will be proportionate with its
truth.”</p>

<p>Once again he saw in waking vision those Divine Forges
he had sought in childhood. On the verge of the Great
Immensity that is beyond the confines of space, he saw
Great Spirits of Fire standing at flaming anvils. And
they lifted up the flames and moulded them on the anvils
into shapes and semblances of men, and the Great Spirits
took these flaming shapes and cast them forth into space,
so that they should become the souls of men.</p>

<p>He was, as Mrs. Mona Caird has truly said of him,
“almost encumbered by the infinity of his perceptions;
by the thronging interests, intuitions, glimpses of wonders,
beauties and mysteries which made life for him a
pageant and a splendour such as is only disclosed to the
soul that has to bear the torment and the revelations of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">[427]</a></span>
genius. He had much to suffer, but in spite of that&mdash;perhaps
partly because of that&mdash;he was able to bring to
all a great sense of sunshine and boyish freshness, of joy
in life and nature and art, and in the adventure and romance
of it all, for those who knew how to dare enough
to go to meet it with open hands. He gave ever the
sense of new power, new thresholds, new realms. His
friendship was a spiritual possession.” And though indeed,
as Mr. Frank Rinder has written “there may be
those inclined to censure William Sharp for his silence
about Fiona Macleod, yet, probably, had the world known,
‘she’&mdash;for in thought it is always that&mdash;would have written
no more. May we not remember Ossian and others
who shrank from revealing to all their secret?... I can
but bear testimony to the ever-ready and eager sympathy,
to the sunny winsomeness, to the nobility of the soul
that has passed. William Sharp was one of the most
lovable, one of the most remarkable men of our time.”</p>

<p>And, I would add,&mdash;to quote my husband’s own words&mdash;ever,
below all the stress and failure, below all the
triumph of his toil, lay the beauty of his dream.</p>
